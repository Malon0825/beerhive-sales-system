# Root Route Redirect Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** Root route (/) was redirecting all users to /pos instead of role-based default routes  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

### Issue Identified
When users accessed `http://localhost:3000/`, **ALL authenticated users** were being redirected to `/pos` (Point of Sale) regardless of their role. This violated the role-based routing specification which should redirect users to their role-appropriate pages.

### Expected Behavior
According to the role-based access control system (`src/lib/utils/roleBasedAccess.ts`), users should be routed as follows:

| Role | Default Route |
|------|--------------|
| Admin | `/` (dashboard) |
| Manager | `/reports` |
| Cashier | `/pos` |
| Kitchen | `/kitchen` |
| Bartender | `/bartender` |
| Waiter | `/waiter` |

### Root Cause
In `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 14-15), there was a hardcoded redirect:
```typescript
// Redirect authenticated users to POS
router.replace('/pos');
```

This ignored the `getDefaultRouteForRole()` utility function that implements proper role-based routing.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Root Page Routing Logic
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Imported role-based utilities:**
   - Added `getDefaultRouteForRole` function
   - Added `UserRole` enum

2. **Updated redirect logic:**
   - Removed hardcoded `/pos` redirect
   - Implemented dynamic routing based on user roles
   - Added comprehensive console logging for debugging

3. **Enhanced user context:**
   - Changed from `{ isAuthenticated, loading }` to `{ user, isAuthenticated, loading }`
   - This provides access to user roles for routing decisions

#### Key Code Changes:
```typescript
// OLD (Incorrect)
if (isAuthenticated) {
  router.replace('/pos'); // ❌ Hardcoded for all users
}

// NEW (Correct)
if (isAuthenticated && user) {
  const defaultRoute = getDefaultRouteForRole(user.roles as UserRole[]);
  router.replace(defaultRoute); // ✅ Role-based routing
}
```

## Console Logging Implementation

### Purpose
Added comprehensive console logging throughout the authentication and routing flow to enable easy debugging of similar issues in the future.

### Logging Locations

#### 1. **AuthContext** (`src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ User loading process
- ✅ Login success/failure
- ✅ Logout process
- ✅ User details (username, roles, userId)

**Example Output:**
```
🔄 [AuthContext] Loading user...
✅ [AuthContext] User loaded successfully: { username: 'john', roles: ['cashier'], ... }
```

#### 2. **Root Page** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Authentication check progress
- ✅ User authentication status
- ✅ User details on successful auth
- ✅ Redirect decisions and destinations

**Example Output:**
```
📍 [Root Page] Authentication check completed
✅ [Root Page] User authenticated: { username: 'john', roles: ['cashier'] }
🎯 [Root Page] Redirecting to role-based default route: { roles: ['cashier'], defaultRoute: '/pos' }
```

#### 3. **Dashboard Page** (`src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`)
- ✅ useEffect triggers
- ✅ User loading status
- ✅ Redirect logic evaluation
- ✅ Customer data fetching

**Example Output:**
```
📍 [Dashboard Page] useEffect triggered: { authLoading: false, hasUser: true, username: 'jane' }
👤 [Dashboard Page] User loaded: { username: 'jane', roles: ['kitchen'] }
🔍 [Dashboard Page] Checking redirect logic: { shouldRedirect: true }
🚀 [Dashboard Page] Redirecting jane to /kitchen
```

#### 4. **RouteGuard** (`src/views/shared/guards/RouteGuard.tsx`)
- ✅ Access checks for protected routes
- ✅ Role verification
- ✅ Authorization decisions
- ✅ Redirect actions

**Example Output:**
```
🛡️ [RouteGuard] Checking access for: /pos
👤 [RouteGuard] User info: { username: 'john', roles: ['cashier'], requiredRoles: ['admin', 'manager', 'cashier'] }
🔐 [RouteGuard] Access check result: { hasAccess: true }
✅ [RouteGuard] Access granted to /pos for john
```

#### 5. **Role-Based Access** (`src/lib/utils/roleBasedAccess.ts`)
- ✅ Default route determination
- ✅ Role priority evaluation
- ✅ Final route selection

**Example Output:**
```
🎯 [roleBasedAccess] Getting default route for roles: ['cashier']
🔍 [roleBasedAccess] Using primary role (first in array): cashier
✅ [roleBasedAccess] Final route for cashier: /pos
```

## Testing Guide

### How to Test the Fix

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or Right-click → Inspect → Console)

2. **Test Each Role:**

   **Admin User:**
   ```
   Expected: Redirect to / (dashboard)
   Console: Should show "routing to /"
   ```

   **Manager User:**
   ```
   Expected: Redirect to /reports
   Console: Should show "routing to /reports"
   ```

   **Cashier User:**
   ```
   Expected: Redirect to /pos
   Console: Should show "routing to /pos"
   ```

   **Kitchen User:**
   ```
   Expected: Redirect to /kitchen
   Console: Should show "routing to /kitchen"
   ```

   **Bartender User:**
   ```
   Expected: Redirect to /bartender
   Console: Should show "routing to /bartender"
   ```

   **Waiter User:**
   ```
   Expected: Redirect to /waiter
   Console: Should show "routing to /waiter"
   ```

3. **Follow the Console Logs:**
   - Look for `[Root Page]` tags to see initial routing
   - Check `[Dashboard Page]` tags if user lands on dashboard
   - Verify `[RouteGuard]` tags for access control
   - Monitor `[roleBasedAccess]` for routing decisions

✅ **Debugging capability** - Console logs provide complete visibility  
✅ **Code maintainability** - Better documentation and comments

### What Stayed the Same
✅ **Dashboard page logic** - No changes to core functionality  
✅ **RouteGuard behavior** - Only added logging, logic unchanged  
✅ **Authentication flow** - Core auth logic preserved  
✅ **Role-based access rules** - Specifications unchanged

### Breaking Changes
❌ **None** - This is a bug fix, not a breaking change

---

## Future Recommendations

### 1. **Add Unit Tests**
Create tests for role-based routing:
```typescript
describe('getDefaultRouteForRole', () => {
  it('should route admin to /', () => {
    expect(getDefaultRouteForRole(['admin'])).toBe('/');
  });
  
  it('should route cashier to /pos', () => {
    expect(getDefaultRouteForRole(['cashier'])).toBe('/pos');
  });
});
```

### 2. **Add Integration Tests**
Test the complete authentication flow:
```typescript
describe('Root Route', () => {
  it('should redirect authenticated cashier to /pos', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### 3. **Consider Production Logging**
For production:
- Reduce console.log verbosity
- Implement proper logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)
- Keep error/warn logs for monitoring

### 4. **Add Role-Based Route Configuration**
Consider a centralized route config:
```typescript
export const ROLE_ROUTES = {
  [UserRole.ADMIN]: '/',
  [UserRole.MANAGER]: '/reports',
  [UserRole.CASHIER]: '/pos',
  // ...
};
```

## Debugging Checklist

When investigating routing issues, check:

- [ ] Browser console for `[Root Page]` logs
- [ ] User roles in `[AuthContext]` logs
- [ ] Route decisions in `[roleBasedAccess]` logs
- [ ] Access control in `[RouteGuard]` logs
- [ ] Network tab for redirect responses
- [ ] Browser's Application tab for cookies/storage
