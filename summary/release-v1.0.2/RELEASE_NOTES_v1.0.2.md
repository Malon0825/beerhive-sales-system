# üç∫ BeerHive Sales System - Release v1.0.2

**Release Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Type:** Patch Release  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Production

---

## üìã Overview

Version 1.0.2 is a critical patch release that addresses kitchen and bartender order management issues, introducing enhanced visibility for cancelled orders and streamlined order cleanup workflows.

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical: Cancelled Orders Visibility Issue
**Issue:** When items were removed from customer tabs while being prepared, they would disappear from kitchen/bartender displays without any notification to staff.

**Impact:** Kitchen and bartender staff would continue preparing cancelled items, leading to:
- Wasted ingredients and preparation time
- Confusion about order status
- Inventory discrepancies

**Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ Cancelled orders now remain visible in kitchen/bartender displays
- ‚úÖ Clear visual indicators (red badge with strikethrough text)
- ‚úÖ Database schema updated to preserve cancelled order records
- ‚úÖ Orders marked as CANCELLED instead of being deleted

**Technical Details:**
- Modified foreign key constraint from `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- Updated `KitchenOrderRepository.getActive()` to include cancelled orders
- Enhanced `OrderItemService` to mark orders as cancelled instead of deleting them

---

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. Clear All Cancelled Orders
**Description:** Bulk delete functionality for cancelled orders to keep displays clean.

**Features:**
- Red "Clear Cancelled" button in kitchen and bartender headers
- Clears all cancelled orders for the respective station (kitchen/bartender)
- Disabled when no cancelled orders exist
- Shows count of cleared orders in success notification
- Available on both mobile and desktop layouts

**Location:** Next to "Sound On" and "Refresh" buttons

**API Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/kitchen/orders/clear-cancelled?destination={kitchen|bartender}`

---

### 2. Individual Order Remove Button
**Description:** Remove specific cancelled orders one at a time.

**Features:**
- Red "Remove" button on each cancelled order card
- Trash icon for clear visual indication
- Immediate removal from display
- Success notification on deletion

**Use Case:** When staff needs to selectively remove cancelled items while keeping others visible

**API Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/kitchen/orders/[orderId]/delete`

---

### 3. Enhanced Order Status Workflow
**Description:** Streamlined order lifecycle for better kitchen/bartender operations.

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **PENDING** orders ‚Üí Visible (awaiting preparation)
- ‚úÖ **PREPARING** orders ‚Üí Visible (being prepared)
- ‚úÖ **READY** orders ‚Üí **Now disappear automatically** (ready for waiter pickup)
- ‚úÖ **CANCELLED** orders ‚Üí Visible until manually removed
- ‚úÖ **SERVED** orders ‚Üí Hidden (completed)

**Benefits:**

- Ready orders don't clutter kitchen/bartender screens
- Cancelled orders remain visible for staff awareness

---

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### Kitchen & Bartender Display Updates

- Removed "Ready" count (orders disappear when ready)
- Added "Cancelled" count with red styling
- Streamlined 3-status display: Pending, Preparing, Cancelled

**Filter Tabs:**

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### Required Migration
**File:** `migrations/release-v1.0.2/fix_kitchen_orders_cascade_delete.sql`

**Changes:**
```sql
-- Update foreign key constraint to preserve cancelled orders
ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS kitchen_orders_order_item_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders
ADD CONSTRAINT kitchen_orders_order_item_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (order_item_id) 
REFERENCES order_items(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Allow order_item_id to be NULL
ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders
ALTER COLUMN order_item_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents automatic deletion of kitchen orders when order items are removed
- Allows cancelled orders to persist for staff visibility
- Maintains referential integrity while supporting the new workflow
