# üç∫ BeerHive Sales System - Release v1.0.2

**Release Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Type:** Patch Release  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Production

---

## üìã Overview

Version 1.0.2 is a critical patch release that addresses kitchen and bartender order management issues, introducing enhanced visibility for cancelled orders and streamlined order cleanup workflows.

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical: Cancelled Orders Visibility Issue
**Issue:** When items were removed from customer tabs while being prepared, they would disappear from kitchen/bartender displays without any notification to staff.

**Impact:** Kitchen and bartender staff would continue preparing cancelled items, leading to:
- Wasted ingredients and preparation time
- Confusion about order status
- Inventory discrepancies

**Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ Cancelled orders now remain visible in kitchen/bartender displays
- ‚úÖ Clear visual indicators (red badge with strikethrough text)
- ‚úÖ Database schema updated to preserve cancelled order records
- ‚úÖ Orders marked as CANCELLED instead of being deleted

**Technical Details:**
- Modified foreign key constraint from `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- Updated `KitchenOrderRepository.getActive()` to include cancelled orders
- Enhanced `OrderItemService` to mark orders as cancelled instead of deleting them

### Payment Dialog Navigation Issue
**Issue:** When closing the "Close Tab & Pay" dialog using either the X button or Close button, users were left with a white screen instead of being redirected back to the tab management page.

**Impact:** Users had to manually navigate back using browser controls

**Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ Dialog now properly redirects to `/tabs` when closed
- ‚úÖ Works for both X button (top right) and Close button
- ‚úÖ Updated `handleClose` function to handle navigation correctly

### Grid Layout Animation Issue
**Issue:** When changing grid column count (3, 4, 5, 6 columns), the layout change was instant without smooth transitions.

**Impact:** Jarring visual experience when adjusting product display layout

**Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ Added key-based re-rendering for proper animation triggers
- ‚úÖ Implemented 500ms smooth transitions for grid restructuring
- ‚úÖ Added fade-in and zoom-in effects (300ms) for product cards
- ‚úÖ Enhanced visual feedback on layout changes

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### Required Migration
**File:** `migrations/release-v1.0.2/fix_kitchen_orders_cascade_delete.sql`

**Changes:**
```sql
-- Update foreign key constraint to preserve cancelled orders
ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS kitchen_orders_order_item_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders
ADD CONSTRAINT kitchen_orders_order_item_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (order_item_id) 
REFERENCES order_items(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Allow order_item_id to be NULL
ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders
ALTER COLUMN order_item_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents automatic deletion of kitchen orders when order items are removed
- Allows cancelled orders to persist for staff visibility
- Maintains referential integrity while supporting the new workflow
