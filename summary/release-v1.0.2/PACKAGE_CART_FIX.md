# Package Cart Fix - Release v1.0.2

## Summary

Fixed critical bug where packages were being decoupled into individual products when added to cart, causing incorrect pricing and defeating the purpose of package discounts.

## Changes Made

### 1. CartContext.tsx
- Updated `CartItem` interface to support both products and packages
- Modified `addPackage()` to add packages as single items with package price
- Fixed cart restoration to handle both product and package items
- Added `isPackage` flag and `itemName` field to CartItem

### 2. OrderSummaryPanel.tsx
- Added package badge display
- Show package contents (included items)
- Disabled quantity controls for packages
- Display "per package" pricing label

### 3. POSInterface.tsx
- Created `handleAddPackage()` function with stock validation
- Check all package item stock before allowing add
- Reserve stock for all items in package
- Release stock for all items when package removed
- Updated `handleRemoveItem()` to handle packages
- Updated `handleUpdateQuantity()` to skip packages

## Technical Details

**Package Addition Flow**:
1. User clicks package in POS
2. System validates stock for ALL package items
3. If any item lacks stock, show detailed error
4. If all OK, reserve stock for each item
5. Add package as single cart item with package price
6. Package appears as one line item in cart

**Kitchen Routing** (No changes needed):
- Existing `KitchenRouting.ts` already expands packages correctly
- Each product routed to appropriate station
- Product names displayed correctly on station screens
- Special instructions note package membership

## Database Schema

No schema changes needed - already supports packages via:
- `current_order_items.package_id` field
- `order_items.package_id` field
- Check constraint ensures item is either product OR package

## Impact

**Before**: 
- Package added as 5 separate items
- Each item priced individually = ₱500 total
- Customer pays ₱500 (no discount)

**After**:
- Package added as 1 item
- Package priced at ₱350 (bundle price)
- Customer pays ₱350 (₱150 discount preserved) ✅

## Testing Status
