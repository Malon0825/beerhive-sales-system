## Key MVP Principles Maintained

‚úÖ **No over-engineering**: Features are practical and essential for pub operations  
‚úÖ **No premature optimization**: Avoided backup systems, advanced security beyond RLS  
‚úÖ **Focused on core business needs**: All features directly support revenue or customer satisfaction  
‚úÖ **Implementable**: All features use existing tech stack capabilities  

---

## Features Deliberately NOT Added (Out of MVP Scope)

‚ùå Automated backup systems - Use Supabase's built-in daily backups  
‚ùå Advanced security features beyond RLS - Basic auth sufficient for MVP  
‚ùå Loyalty points calculation system - Tracking only, no complex redemption  
‚ùå Mobile app - Web-responsive design sufficient for MVP  
‚ùå Online ordering - Focus on in-house operations first  
‚ùå Inventory forecasting AI - Basic reorder point logic sufficient  
‚ùå Staff scheduling system - Focus on POS operations only  

---

## Implementation Priority Recommendation

**Phase 1** (Foundation):
- Database schema deployment

- Table assignment in POS
- Kitchen/Bartender order routing
- Basic customer event tracking

**Phase 3** (Revenue Optimization):

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Database migration: Run Database Structure.sql

4. üîÑ Implement frontend components according to updated Tech Stack structure
5. üîÑ Build kitchen/bartender display interfaces
6. üîÑ Test real-time subscriptions across all new tables
