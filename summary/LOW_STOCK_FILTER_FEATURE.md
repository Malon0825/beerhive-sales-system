# Low Stock Alert Filter Feature

## Feature Overview
Converted the summary statistics cards in the Low Stock Alerts section into interactive filter buttons, allowing users to quickly filter alerts by urgency level.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
**`src/views/inventory/LowStockAlert.tsx`**

### New Features

#### 1. **Clickable Filter Cards**
All five summary cards are now clickable buttons that filter the alerts:
- **Total Alerts** - Shows all alerts (default)
- **Critical** - Shows alerts with urgency ≥ 70
- **Urgent** - Shows alerts with urgency ≥ 50 and < 70
- **Moderate** - Shows alerts with urgency ≥ 30 and < 50
- **Low** - Shows alerts with urgency < 30

#### 2. **Visual Feedback**
- **Hover State**: Cards show border highlight and shadow on hover
- **Active State**: Selected filter has:
  - Darker background
  - 2px colored border (matches category color)
  - Increased shadow
  - Bolder text

#### 3. **Filter Indicator Banner**
When a filter is active (not "all"), a banner appears showing:
- Icon and filtered count (e.g., "Showing 5 critical alerts")
- "Clear Filter" button to reset to all alerts

#### 4. **Empty State**
If a filter returns no results, shows a friendly empty state message:
- Icon and message indicating no alerts in that category
- Helps users understand the filter is working but no results match

### Implementation Details

#### Filter Logic
```typescript
const filterAlerts = (alerts: any[], filter: AlertFilter): any[] => {
  if (filter === 'all') return alerts;

  return alerts.filter((alert) => {
    const urgency = alert.urgency;
    switch (filter) {
      case 'critical': return urgency >= 70;
      case 'urgent': return urgency >= 50 && urgency < 70;
      case 'moderate': return urgency >= 30 && urgency < 50;
      case 'low': return urgency < 30;
      default: return true;
    }
  });
};
```

#### State Management
```typescript
type AlertFilter = 'all' | 'critical' | 'urgent' | 'moderate' | 'low';
const [activeFilter, setActiveFilter] = useState<AlertFilter>('all');
const filteredAlerts = filterAlerts(alerts, activeFilter);
```

#### Card Styling
Each card uses conditional classes for:
- Active state (selected filter)
- Hover state (unselected filters)
- Color theming matching the urgency level

### User Experience Improvements

#### Before
- Cards were static display-only elements
- Users had to manually scroll through all alerts
- No quick way to focus on specific urgency levels

#### After
- **Quick Filtering**: Click any card to instantly filter
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear indication of active filter
- **Better Navigation**: See filtered count and clear filter easily
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile (2 columns) and desktop (5 columns)
- **Accessible**: Semantic button elements with proper hover/focus states

### Example User Flows

#### Filter to Critical Alerts
1. User clicks "Critical" card
2. Card highlights with red border and shadow
3. Banner appears: "Showing X critical alerts"
4. List shows only critical urgency items
5. User clicks "Clear Filter" or "Total Alerts" to reset

#### Check Specific Category
1. User sees "Urgent: 0" on card
2. Clicks to verify
3. Empty state confirms no urgent alerts
4. User confident that category is clear

### Color Scheme

| Filter | Background (Normal) | Background (Active) | Border (Active) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Total Alerts | White | Blue-50 | Blue-500 |
| Critical | Red-50 | Red-100 | Red-500 |
| Urgent | Orange-50 | Orange-100 | Orange-500 |
| Moderate | Yellow-50 | Yellow-100 | Yellow-500 |
| Low | Gray-50 | Gray-100 | Gray-500 |

### Technical Notes

- **Type Safety**: Added `AlertFilter` type for filter states
- **Performance**: Filter function runs on state change (minimal overhead)
- **Accessibility**: 
  - Semantic `<button>` elements
  - Clear hover/focus states
  - Keyboard navigable
- **Responsive**: Grid layout adjusts from 2 to 5 columns
