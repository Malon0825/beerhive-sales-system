# POS Drink Stock Filtering - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented intelligent stock filtering in the POS system to automatically hide drinks/beverages with zero stock while keeping food items and packages (assembled products) always visible.

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Beers and non-alcoholic drinks were displayed in POS even when out of stock, causing confusion and failed orders.

**Solution**: Auto-hide drinks with `current_stock = 0` while maintaining visibility of food products and assembled packages.

## Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **src/views/pos/POSInterface.tsx**
   - Added `isDrinkProduct()` helper function
   - Added `isProductAvailable()` helper function
   - Updated all product filters to apply stock rules
   - Added stock status indicators

### Key Changes

#### 1. Helper Functions Added

```typescript
/**
 * Check if a product is a drink/beverage
 * Detects products in Beer, Beverage, Drink, or Alcohol categories
 */
const isDrinkProduct = (product: Product): boolean => {
  const categoryName = (product as any).category?.name?.toLowerCase() || '';
  return categoryName.includes('beer') || 
         categoryName.includes('beverage') || 
         categoryName.includes('drink') ||
         categoryName.includes('alcohol');
};

/**
 * Check if product should be visible based on stock
 * Drinks: Hidden if stock = 0
 * Others: Always visible
 */
const isProductAvailable = (product: Product): boolean => {
  if (isDrinkProduct(product)) {
    return product.current_stock > 0;
  }
  return true; // Food and other products always available
};
```

#### 2. Filters Updated

- **All Products Tab**: Applied `isProductAvailable()` filter
- **Featured Tab**: Applied `isProductAvailable()` filter
- **Beer Tab**: Explicit `current_stock > 0` check
- **Food Tab**: No stock filtering
- **Packages Tab**: No stock filtering (not affected)

#### 3. UI Improvements

- Low stock warning: Shows when `current_stock <= reorder_point && > 0`
- Out of stock indicator: Shows for non-drink products with 0 stock
- Improved stock display logic

## Filtering Rules

| Product Type | Category Keywords | Stock = 0 Behavior |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Drinks** | beer, beverage, drink, alcohol | ❌ Hidden |
| **Food** | food, appetizer, snack, pulutan | ✅ Visible |
| **Packages** | (Any) | ✅ Visible |

## Code Standards Compliance

✅ **Function Comments**: All helper functions documented  
✅ **Logic Comments**: Complex filtering explained  
✅ **Component Structure**: Follows existing patterns  
✅ **Next.js Best Practices**: Client-side filtering optimized  

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Out-of-Stock Beer
- **Setup**: Beer with `current_stock = 0`
- **Result**: Hidden from all tabs
- **Expected**: ✅ Not visible, cannot be added

### Scenario 2: Low-Stock Beer
- **Setup**: Beer with `current_stock = 5`, `reorder_point = 10`
- **Result**: Visible with "Low Stock" warning
- **Expected**: ✅ Can be added to cart

### Scenario 3: Out-of-Stock Food
- **Setup**: Food with `current_stock = 0`
- **Result**: Still visible with "Out of Stock" indicator
- **Expected**: ✅ Can be added (kitchen confirms availability)

### Scenario 4: Packages
- **Setup**: Package regardless of component stock
- **Result**: Always visible in Packages tab
- **Expected**: ✅ Availability validated during cart operations

## Quick Test

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Set a beer to 0 stock
# SQL:
UPDATE products SET current_stock = 0 WHERE name = 'San Miguel Beer';

# 3. Navigate to POS
http://localhost:3000/pos

# 4. Check tabs
- All Products: Beer should NOT appear
- Beer Tab: Beer should NOT appear
- Packages Tab: All packages still visible
```

## Benefits

✅ **Better UX**: Customers don't see unavailable drinks  
✅ **Reduced Errors**: Prevents orders for out-of-stock items  
✅ **Flexibility**: Food items remain visible for kitchen confirmation  
✅ **Package Support**: Assembled products not affected by individual stock  
✅ **Clear Indicators**: Low stock warnings help staff manage inventory  

## Performance

- **Filtering Method**: Client-side (browser)
- **Complexity**: O(n) - linear scan of product array
- **Impact**: Negligible - < 1ms for typical product counts
- **Memory**: No additional overhead

## API Requirements

The `/api/products` endpoint must return:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "current_stock": 25,
  "reorder_point": 10,
  "category": {
    "name": "Beer"
  }
}
```

**Critical Fields**:
- `current_stock`: Number (required)
- `category.name`: String (required for drink detection)

## Documentation

- **Complete Guide**: `docs/POS_STOCK_FILTERING.md`
- **Implementation**: `src/views/pos/POSInterface.tsx` (lines 219-282)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Drinks still showing with 0 stock | Verify category name includes drink keywords |
| Food hidden when out of stock | Check category name is food-related |
| Package not showing | Packages never filtered - check `is_active` flag |

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time stock updates via WebSocket
2. Stock reservation during cart operations
3. Predictive low-stock alerts
4. Custom filtering rules per category
