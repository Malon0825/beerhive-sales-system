# Events Module Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Priority**: High

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Syntax Error in EventList.tsx
**Error Message**:
```
Error: Expected '}', got '<eof>'
at EventList.tsx:226:1
```

**Root Cause**: Missing closing brace for the `EventCard` function component.

**Solution**: Added the missing closing brace at line 230.

### 2. Server-Side Supabase Client Issue in EventRepository
**Error Message**:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/events 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

**Root Cause**: `EventRepository` was using the client-side Supabase client (`supabase` from `'../supabase/client'`) instead of the server-side admin client (`supabaseAdmin` from `'../supabase/server-client'`).

This caused issues because:
- API routes run on the server and need elevated permissions
- Client-side Supabase has RLS (Row Level Security) restrictions
- Server operations require the admin client for proper database access

**Solution**: Changed all instances to use `supabaseAdmin` for server-side database operations.

## Files Modified

### `src/views/events/EventList.tsx`
- **Change**: Added missing closing brace for `EventCard` function
- **Change**: Changed import from `RedemptionService` to `RedemptionUtils`
- **Change**: Updated all function calls to use `RedemptionUtils`
- **Lines**: 4, 64-65, 230
- **Impact**: Fixes syntax error and prevents server-side code from being bundled in client

### `src/data/repositories/EventRepository.ts`
- **Change**: Replaced `supabase` with `supabaseAdmin` throughout the file
- **Lines**: Import statement (line 1) and all database queries
- **Impact**: Enables proper server-side database access with admin permissions
- **Comments Added**: Enhanced JSDoc comments for better code documentation

### `src/core/services/events/RedemptionUtils.ts` ✨ NEW
- **Purpose**: Client-safe utility functions for event offer redemption
- **Functions**: `validateOffer`, `calculateDiscount`, `applyOffer`, `isExpiringSoon`, `getDaysUntilExpiry`, `formatOffer`
- **Impact**: Pure functions with no database dependencies, safe for client components
- **Comments**: Full JSDoc documentation on all methods

### `src/core/services/events/RedemptionService.ts`
- **Change**: Refactored to delegate pure functions to `RedemptionUtils`
- **Change**: Added deprecation warnings for methods that should use `RedemptionUtils` in client
- **Change**: Kept server-side methods (`redeem`, `markRedeemed`) with database access
- **Impact**: Clear separation between client-safe and server-only code

## Code Standards Applied

✅ **Server/Client Separation**: Used correct Supabase client for server-side operations
✅ **Comments**: Added/enhanced JSDoc comments on key methods
✅ **Error Handling**: Maintained existing error handling patterns
✅ **Type Safety**: Preserved TypeScript type annotations

## Testing Required

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/events` page
2. Verify page loads without errors
3. Test creating a new customer event
4. Test editing an existing event
5. Test deleting an event
6. Verify event redemption workflow
7. Check active events display on POS interface

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Events page loads without 500 errors
- ✅ Events list displays customer events with customer details
- ✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) work correctly
- ✅ Event filtering works (by customer, type, redemption status)
- ✅ Event badges display correctly (Birthday, Anniversary, Custom)
- ✅ Expiry warnings show for events nearing expiration

## Related Components

- **API Route**: `src/app/api/events/route.ts` - Uses EventRepository for data access
- **View Components**: 
  - `src/views/events/EventList.tsx` - Displays events
  - `src/views/events/EventForm.tsx` - Create/edit events
  - `src/views/events/EventManager.tsx` - Main events management interface
- **Services**:
  - `src/core/services/events/EventService.ts` - Business logic
  - `src/core/services/events/RedemptionService.ts` - Redemption handling

## Similar Pattern Applied

This fix follows the same pattern as the HappyHourRepository fix:
- **Rule**: Repositories used in API routes must use `supabaseAdmin`
- **Rule**: Client components should not directly import repositories
- **Rule**: Data flow: Client Component → API Route → Repository → Database

## Pre-existing Type Issues Noted

Minor TypeScript type compatibility warnings exist between database return types and `CustomerEvent` interface. These are cosmetic and don't affect runtime functionality. They relate to nullable vs non-nullable types from the database schema.

## Completion Status

✅ Syntax error fixed
✅ Repository updated to use server-side client
✅ Code documented with comments
✅ Follows architecture standards
⏳ Manual testing pending
