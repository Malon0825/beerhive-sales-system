- **`src/views/order-board/OrderBoardCard.tsx`** (140 lines) - Individual order card display

### 3. API Endpoint
- **`src/app/api/orders/board/route.ts`** - GET endpoint to fetch orders with full details

### 4. Repository Enhancement

- ✅ Supabase Realtime subscription (no polling required)
- ✅ Manual refresh option

### Order Display
- ✅ Order number, customer info, table info
- ✅ Complete list of order items with quantities and prices
- ✅ Color-coded status badges (pending, completed, voided)
- ✅ Timestamps for each order

### Filtering & Statistics
- ✅ Filter by status: All, Pending, Completed, Voided
- ✅ Statistics dashboard showing counts by status
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (1-3 columns based on screen size)

## 🏗️ Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Clean Architecture Pattern
```
Page Route → API Endpoint → Repository → Database
         ↓
    View Component
```

### ✅ Code Standards
- All functions have JSDoc comments
- No file exceeds 200 lines (well under 500 line limit)
- Follows Next.js App Router patterns
- Uses existing project structure and conventions
- TypeScript types throughout

### ✅ No Breaking Changes
- All code is additive
- No existing functionality modified
- Existing tables and schemas unchanged
- Compatible with current POS, Kitchen, and other modules

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Subscription
```typescript
useRealtime({
  table: 'orders',
  event: '*',
  onChange: handleOrderUpdate,
});
```

### API Integration
```typescript
GET /api/orders/board
Query params: status (optional), limit (optional, default: 50)
Response: { success: true, orders: [...], count: number }
```

### Database Query
```typescript
OrderRepository.getAllWithDetails({
  status?: string,
  limit?: number
})
// Returns orders with customer, table, and order_items joined
```

## 📱 Usage

1. **Access**: Navigate to `/order-board` in the dashboard
2. **View**: See all orders in real-time as cards
3. **Filter**: Click status buttons to filter orders
4. **Refresh**: Use refresh button for manual update
5. **Real-time**: Orders automatically appear/update when cashiers create them

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

To test the implementation:

1. ✅ Navigate to `/order-board` page
2. ✅ Create a new order from POS
3. ✅ Verify order appears on board in real-time
4. ✅ Update order status - verify badge updates
5. ✅ Test all filter options
6. ✅ Verify statistics update correctly
7. ✅ Test manual refresh
8. ✅ Check responsive design

## 🔐 Security

- Uses `supabaseAdmin` client (consistent with existing code)
- Accessible to all authenticated users
- No sensitive payment data exposed
- RLS policies bypassed for read operations (standard pattern in codebase)

## 📊 Database Requirements

### Existing Tables Used
- `orders` - Main order data
- `order_items` - Order line items
- `customers` - Customer information
- `restaurant_tables` - Table information

### Realtime Configuration
Ensure `orders` table has Realtime enabled in Supabase:
- Database → Replication → Enable for `orders` table

## 🚀 Next Steps

The feature is ready for testing. To verify:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/order-board`
3. Create an order from the POS interface
4. Watch the order appear on the board in real-time
