# Role-Based Access Control Fix - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Developer**: Expert Software Developer  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Problem Fixed

### 1. Waiter Role Routing Bug
- **Before**: Waiter users were redirected to `/pos` (Point of Sale) after login
- **After**: Waiter users correctly redirect to `/waiter` page
- **Root Cause**: Role-based routing was implemented but not enforced properly

### 2. Unauthorized Access
- **Before**: Any authenticated user could access any page by typing the URL
  - Waiter could access `/pos` and create orders
  - Kitchen staff could access `/reports` and view analytics
  - Cashier could access `/inventory` and modify stock
- **After**: Users can only access pages authorized for their role
  - Server-side middleware blocks unauthorized requests
  - Client-side guards prevent rendering
  - Automatic redirect to user's default page

---

## Implementation Summary

### Three-Layer Security Architecture

1. **Server-Side Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`)
   - Intercepts all requests before page loads
   - Checks authentication cookies
   - Verifies role permissions
   - Redirects unauthorized users immediately

2. **Client-Side Route Guards** (`src/views/shared/guards/RouteGuard.tsx`)
   - Verifies user role before rendering page
   - Shows loading state during check
   - Logs security events to console
   - Redirects if unauthorized

3. **Centralized Access Rules** (`src/lib/utils/roleBasedAccess.ts`)
   - Single source of truth for route permissions
   - Maps routes to allowed roles
   - Provides helper functions for access checks

## Files Modified

### Authentication System
1. **`src/middleware.ts`**
   - Added route access checking
   - Cookie-based authentication
   - Role-based authorization

2. **`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`**
   - Sets `auth-token` cookie (HttpOnly)
   - Sets `user-role` cookie (HttpOnly)
   - Secure cookie configuration

3. **`src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`**
   - Clears authentication cookies
   - Complete session cleanup

4. **`src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Uses centralized routing utility
   - Calls logout API to clear cookies

## Security Features

### 1. HttpOnly Cookies
```typescript
{
  httpOnly: true,        // JS cannot access
  secure: true,          // HTTPS only in production
  sameSite: 'lax',       // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 604800,        // 7 days
}
```

### 2. Middleware Protection (Server-Side)
- Runs before page loads
- Checks authentication state
- Validates role permissions
- Blocks unauthorized requests

### 3. Route Guard Protection (Client-Side)
- Verifies role before rendering
- Shows loading spinner
- Logs access attempts
- Automatic redirects

### 4. Automatic Redirects
- Unauthorized access → redirect to user's default page
- Waiter trying to access `/pos` → redirected to `/waiter`
- Kitchen trying to access `/reports` → redirected to `/kitchen`

---

## Testing Scenarios

```bash
# Login
Username: waiter
Password: Waiter123!

# Expected Results:
- Login → Redirect to /waiter ✅
- Access /waiter → Success ✅
- Access /pos → Redirect to /waiter ✅
- Access /reports → Redirect to /waiter ✅
- Access /inventory → Redirect to /waiter ✅
```

### ✅ Cashier Role

Password: Cashier123!

# Expected Results:
- Login → Redirect to /pos ✅
- Access /pos → Success ✅
- Access /kitchen → Redirect to /pos ✅
- Access /waiter → Redirect to /pos ✅
- Access /reports → Redirect to /pos ✅
```

### ✅ Admin Role
```bash
# Login
Username: admin
Password: Admin123!

# Expected Results:

- No restrictions ✅
```

## Console Output Examples

### Successful Access
```javascript
✅ Login successful: waiter (waiter) → redirecting to /waiter
```

⛔ Access denied: waiter (waiter) tried to access /pos
↪️  Redirecting to: /waiter
```

### Middleware Logs
```javascript
⛔ Middleware: Access denied to /reports for role waiter
↪️  Redirecting to: /waiter
```
