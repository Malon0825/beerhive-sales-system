## API Integration

### Endpoint: `PATCH /api/tables/:tableId`

**Actions Supported**:

  action: 'reserve' | 'occupy' | 'release' | 'markCleaned' | 'cancelReservation',
  notes?: string,  // Optional reservation notes
  orderId?: string // Optional order ID for occupancy
}
```

**Examples**:

```typescript
// Reserve a table
PATCH /api/tables/table-123
{
  "action": "reserve",
  "notes": "Reserved for John Doe at 7:00 PM"
}

// Occupy a table (walk-in)
PATCH /api/tables/table-123
{
  "action": "occupy"
}

// Release table to cleaning
PATCH /api/tables/table-123
{
  "action": "release"
}

// Mark table as cleaned
PATCH /api/tables/table-123
{
  "action": "markCleaned"
}

// Cancel reservation
PATCH /api/tables/table-123
{
  "action": "cancelReservation"
}
```

## User Flow

### Reserving a Table

1. Staff clicks "Reserve" button on an available table
2. Reservation dialog opens with notes field
3. Staff enters optional notes (e.g., "VIP customer, window seat")
4. Staff clicks "Confirm Reservation"
5. API updates table status to 'reserved'
6. Success toast appears
7. Table card updates in real-time
8. Color changes to yellow border

### Occupying a Table

1. **Walk-in Customer**:
   - Staff clicks "Occupy" on available table
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Staff confirms
   - Table marked as occupied

2. **Reserved Customer Arrives**:
   - Staff clicks "Occupy" on reserved table
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Staff confirms
   - Reservation converted to occupancy

### Releasing a Table

1. Customer finishes and pays
2. Staff clicks "To Cleaning" on occupied table
3. Table status changes to 'cleaning'
4. Housekeeping cleans table
5. Staff clicks "Set Available"
6. Table returns to available status

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Local state for dialogs and selected table
- Toast state with auto-dismiss (3 seconds)
- Real-time state sync via Supabase subscriptions

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- User-friendly error messages in toasts
- API error responses properly handled
- TypeScript type assertions for Supabase data

### Type Safety
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Type-safe action handlers
- Enum usage for table statuses
- Type casting for Supabase responses

### Performance
- useCallback for memoized fetch function
- Debounced filter changes (implicit)
- Optimistic UI updates via real-time subscriptions
- Minimal re-renders with targeted state updates

---

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Component Composition**
   - Separate dialog components
   - Reusable TableCard component
   - Modular action handlers

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI logic in components
   - Business logic in API routes
   - Data access in repositories
   - Services for complex operations

3. **User Feedback**
   - Loading states during operations
   - Success/error toast notifications
   - Visual status indicators
   - Disabled states during processing

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Supabase subscriptions
   - Automatic state synchronization
   - Multi-user coordination

## Color Coding

| Status | Color | Border | Badge |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Available | Green | `border-green-300` | Green dot |
| Occupied | Red | `border-red-300` | Red dot |
| Reserved | Yellow | `border-yellow-300` | Yellow dot |
| Cleaning | Gray | `border-gray-300` | Gray dot |

## Notes for Developers

1. **Type Casting**: Supabase returns nullable fields, so we use `as Table[]` for type assertion
2. **Admin Client**: Some operations use `supabaseAdmin` to bypass RLS
3. **Real-time**: Tables page subscribes to `restaurant_tables` changes
4. **API Pattern**: All actions go through centralized API route with action parameter
5. **Toast Duration**: Auto-dismiss after 3000ms (adjustable in component)
