# Login Redirect Fix - Dashboard First Approach

## Issue
When users logged in or navigated to `http://localhost:3000/`, they were immediately redirected to their role-specific pages and couldn't access the dashboard, even admin/manager/cashier users.

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Issue Type**: Login Flow & Routing  
**Status**: Fixed

---

## Root Cause

The system had **conflicting redirect logic** in two places:

### 1. AuthContext Login (Line 58-60)
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Redirected immediately after login
const defaultRoute = getDefaultRouteForRole(authUser.roles);
router.push(defaultRoute);
```

This meant:
- Admin â†’ redirected to `/`
- Manager â†’ redirected to `/reports`
- Cashier â†’ redirected to `/pos`
- Kitchen â†’ redirected to `/kitchen`
- etc.

### 2. Dashboard Page
The dashboard page had logic to redirect only kitchen/bartender/waiter, but users never reached it because the login already sent them elsewhere.

---

## Solution

**Changed login to always redirect to `/` first**, then let the dashboard page handle role-based redirects.

### Updated AuthContext
**File**: `src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Always go to dashboard first
const login = useCallback(async (username: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    const authUser = await AuthService.login({ username, password });
    setUser(authUser);
    
    // Always redirect to dashboard after login
    // Dashboard page will handle role-based redirects for kitchen/bartender/waiter
    console.log(`âœ… Login successful: ${authUser.username} â†’ redirecting to dashboard`);
    router.push('/');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}, [router]);
```

## Login Flow Now

### Admin Login
```
1. Login as admin
   â†“
2. AuthContext redirects to /
   â†“
3. Dashboard page loads
   â†“
4. Check role: ADMIN (not kitchen/bartender/waiter)
   â†“
5. No redirect
   â†“
6. âœ… Admin sees dashboard
```

### Manager Login
```
1. Login as manager
   â†“
2. AuthContext redirects to /
   â†“
3. Dashboard page loads
   â†“
4. Check role: MANAGER (not kitchen/bartender/waiter)
   â†“
5. No redirect
   â†“
6. âœ… Manager sees dashboard
```

### Cashier Login
```
1. Login as cashier
   â†“
2. AuthContext redirects to /
   â†“
3. Dashboard page loads
   â†“
4. Check role: CASHIER (not kitchen/bartender/waiter)
   â†“
5. No redirect
   â†“
6. âœ… Cashier sees dashboard
```

### Kitchen Staff Login
```
1. Login as kitchen
   â†“
2. AuthContext redirects to /
   â†“
3. Dashboard page loads
   â†“
4. Check role: KITCHEN (is in redirect list!)
   â†“
5. Redirect to /kitchen
   â†“
6. âœ… Kitchen staff sees kitchen display
```

## Complete Redirect Matrix

| Role | Login Redirect | Dashboard Behavior | Final Page |
|------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Admin | â†’ `/` | No redirect | `/` Dashboard |
| Manager | â†’ `/` | No redirect | `/` Dashboard |
| Cashier | â†’ `/` | No redirect | `/` Dashboard |
| Kitchen | â†’ `/` | â†’ `/kitchen` | `/kitchen` Display |
| Bartender | â†’ `/` | â†’ `/bartender` | `/bartender` Display |
| Waiter | â†’ `/` | â†’ `/waiter` | `/waiter` Display |

## Testing

### Test Admin/Manager/Cashier Access
1. Login as admin/manager/cashier
2. Should land on `/` dashboard
3. Dashboard content should display
4. No automatic redirect
5. Can manually navigate to other pages

### Test Kitchen/Bartender/Waiter Redirect
1. Login as kitchen/bartender/waiter
2. Will briefly see `/` loading
3. Should auto-redirect to work page
4. Console shows: `ðŸ”„ Redirecting [user] to [page]`

### Test Manual Navigation
1. Login as any user
2. Manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
3. Behavior depends on role:
   - Admin/Manager/Cashier: Stays on dashboard
   - Kitchen/Bartender/Waiter: Redirected to work page

---

## Files Changed

### 1. AuthContext.tsx
**File**: `src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Before**:
- Redirected to role-specific page after login
- Used `getDefaultRouteForRole()` function

**After**:
- Always redirects to `/` after login
- Dashboard handles subsequent redirects

### 2. Dashboard Page (No Changes)
**File**: `src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`

- Already had correct logic
- Only redirects kitchen/bartender/waiter
- Now works properly since users reach it

---

## Benefits

### âœ… Consistent Behavior
- All users start at same place (`/`)
- Predictable login flow
- Easier to debug

### âœ… Single Source of Truth
- Dashboard page is the only place that decides redirects
- No conflicting logic
- Clear separation of concerns

### âœ… Better UX
- Admin/Manager/Cashier can use dashboard
- Kitchen/Bartender/Waiter still get fast access to work pages
- Everyone gets appropriate interface

---

## Console Logging

### Login Logs
```
âœ… Login successful: admin (admin) â†’ redirecting to dashboard
âœ… Login successful: cashier1 (cashier) â†’ redirecting to dashboard
âœ… Login successful: chef1 (kitchen) â†’ redirecting to dashboard
```

### Dashboard Redirect Logs (only for kitchen/bartender/waiter)
```
ðŸ”„ Redirecting chef1 (kitchen) to /kitchen
ðŸ”„ Redirecting bartender1 (bartender) to /bartender
ðŸ”„ Redirecting waiter1 (waiter) to /waiter
```

No redirect logs for admin/manager/cashier.

## Architecture Notes

### Centralized Redirect Logic
The system now has clear redirect responsibilities:

**AuthContext** (Login)
- Role: Handle authentication
- Redirect: Always to `/` after successful login
- Purpose: Get user into the app

**Dashboard Page**
- Role: Landing page and role-based routing
- Redirect: Only kitchen/bartender/waiter to work pages
- Purpose: Show dashboard or route to work page

**Middleware**
- Role: Route protection
- Redirect: Block unauthorized access
- Purpose: Security layer

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### Direct URL Access
- User types `/` in browser
- Dashboard page redirect logic applies
- Works correctly for all roles

### Page Refresh
- User refreshes on any page
- Auth persists via cookies
- No unwanted redirects

### Multi-Role Users
- Example: User with `['kitchen', 'bartender']`
- Will be redirected (has kitchen role)
- Goes to primary role's page
