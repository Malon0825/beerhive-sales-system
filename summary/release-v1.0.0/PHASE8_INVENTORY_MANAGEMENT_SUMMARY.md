## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Repository Pattern

**InventoryRepository** (9 methods):
- `getAllMovements()` - Get movements with filtering
- `getMovementById()` - Get single movement
- `logMovement()` - Create movement record
- `getLowStockProducts()` - Get products below reorder point
- `updateStock()` - Update product stock level
- `adjustStock()` - Adjust with movement logging
- `getStockStatistics()` - Get overall stats
- `getMovementsByProduct()` - Product-specific history

**SupplierRepository** (9 methods):
- `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`
- `deactivate()`, `reactivate()`, `search()`
- `generateSupplierCode()` - Auto code generation

**PurchaseOrderRepository** (6 methods):
- `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()`
- `updateStatus()`, `recordReceipt()`, `getBySupplier()`
- `generatePONumber()` - Auto PO numbering

### Service Layer

**InventoryService**:
- Stock status determination
- Adjustment validation

- Label formatting and utilities

**StockDeduction**:
- `deductForOrder()` - Auto deduction
- `returnForVoidedOrder()` - Stock return
- `checkStockAvailability()` - Availability checking

- `getCriticalAlerts()` - Filter critical only
- `getAlertSummary()` - Statistics
- `getReorderRecommendations()` - Purchase suggestions
- Urgency calculation and scoring

### API Design

**GET /api/inventory/movements**
- Query params: product_id, movement_type, date_from, date_to, limit
- Returns: Movement history with user and product details

**POST /api/inventory/adjust**
- Body: product_id, quantity_change, movement_type, reason, notes
- Validation: Stock availability, manager approval
- Returns: Adjustment result with warnings

**GET /api/inventory/low-stock**
- Query params: type (all, critical, summary, recommendations)
- Returns: Alerts with urgency scores and reorder info
