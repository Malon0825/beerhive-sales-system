- Success/error toast notifications
- Loading states

**Props:**
```typescript
interface EditProductDialogProps {
  product: Product | null;

}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `ProductForm.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added `product` prop for edit mode
- Added `isEditMode` flag
- Pre-fills form data when product provided
- Changed button text based on mode ("Create" vs "Update")

}
```

    product.sku.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  
  const matchesActiveFilter = showInactive ? true : (product.is_active !== false);
  
  return matchesSearch && matchesActiveFilter;
});
```

### 3. `ProductRepository.ts`
**Changes:**
- Updated `getAll()` to accept `includeInactive` parameter
- Modified query to optionally include inactive products

**Updated Signature:**
```typescript
static async getAll(includeInactive: boolean = false): Promise<Product[]>
```

### 4. `src/app/api/products/route.ts`
**Changes:**
- Added `includeInactive` query parameter support
- Documentation updated with new parameter
- Passes parameter to repository

## UI Components

   - Visual: Green (Activate) / Red outline (Deactivate)
   - Soft delete - no data loss

### Visual Indicators

## API Updates

## Validation & Business Rules

### Edit Product Validation
- SKU required
- Name required
- Base price must be > 0
- VIP price must be < base price (if provided)
- Stock cannot be negative
- Alcohol percentage between 0-100 (if provided)

### Active/Inactive Rules
- **Inactive products:**
  - Not shown in POS
  - Not included in inventory statistics
  - Cannot adjust stock
  - Can be edited
  - Can be reactivated
  - Data preserved (soft delete)

- **Active products:**
  - Shown in POS
  - Included in statistics
  - Can adjust stock
  - Can be edited
  - Can be deactivated

## Important Details Handled

### Price Updates
- ✅ Base price
- ✅ VIP price
- ✅ Cost price
- ✅ Validation ensures VIP < Base

### Inventory Updates
- ✅ Current stock
- ✅ Reorder point
- ✅ Reorder quantity
- ✅ Unit of measure

### Product Information
- ✅ SKU (unique identifier)
- ✅ Product name
- ✅ Description
- ✅ Barcode

### Additional Details
- ✅ Size/variant

### Status Management

## Statistics Handling
Active product statistics only count products where `is_active !== false`:
- Total products
- Low stock count
- Out of stock count
- Adequate stock count

Inactive products are excluded from all stats to reflect actual available inventory.

## Security & Best Practices

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Soft delete prevents data loss
- ✅ Product history preserved
- ✅ Can reactivate anytime
- ✅ No cascade delete issues

### User Experience
- ✅ Clear visual feedback
- ✅ Success/error toasts
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Confirmation not needed (easily reversible)
- ✅ Tooltips on buttons

### Performance
- ✅ Inactive products loaded only when needed
- ✅ Filtered client-side
- ✅ Sorted server-side (active first)
