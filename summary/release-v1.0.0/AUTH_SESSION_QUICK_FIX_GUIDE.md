# Auth & Session Fix - Quick Reference

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL FIX**  
**Status**: ✅ **READY TO DEPLOY**

---

## What Was Fixed

### 🐛 **Bug 1: Admin Session Corrupted When Creating Users**
- **Problem**: Creating a user would log out the admin in production
- **Cause**: Shared Supabase client caused session interference
- **Fix**: Each login now uses an isolated client

### ⏰ **Bug 2: Staff Logged Out Every 30 Minutes**
- **Problem**: Session timeout too short for bar operations
- **Cause**: Default 30-minute timeout
- **Fix**: Extended to 24-hour sessions

### 🔄 **Bug 3: Tokens Expired After 1 Hour**
- **Problem**: "Unauthorized" errors mid-shift
- **Cause**: No automatic token refresh
- **Fix**: Auto-refresh every 50 minutes
