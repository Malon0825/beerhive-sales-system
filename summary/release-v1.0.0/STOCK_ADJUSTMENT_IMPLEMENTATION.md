## User Flow

1. **User views inventory list** â†’ Sees products with current stock levels
2. **User clicks "Adjust" button** for a specific product â†’ Dialog opens
3. **Dialog shows product details** â†’ Current stock, SKU displayed
4. **User fills adjustment form:**
   - Selects movement type (Stock In/Out/Transfer/Physical Count)

   - Enters quantity change (+/- values)
   - Optionally adds unit cost

6. **User submits:**
   - API validates the adjustment
   - Stock is updated in database
   - Inventory movement record created
   - Success toast appears
   - Dialog closes
   - Product list refreshes with new stock levels

## Validation Rules

### Field Validation
- âœ… Product ID required
- âœ… Quantity change required (must be valid number)
- âœ… Movement type required
- âœ… Reason required

### Business Logic Validation
- âœ… **Negative Stock Check:** Warns if adjustment results in negative stock
- âœ… **Large Adjustment Warning:** Shows warning if change > 50% of current stock
- âœ… **Manager Approval:** Required for adjustments > 10% of current stock
- âœ… **Submit Disabled:** If negative stock would result (unless override)

## Movement Types

1. **Stock In** - Adding inventory (purchases, returns)
2. **Stock Out** - Removing inventory (damage, theft, waste)
3. **Transfer** - Moving inventory between locations
4. **Physical Count** - Adjusting to match actual count

## Reasons

1. **Purchase** - Received from supplier
2. **Damaged** - Product damaged
3. **Expired** - Product past expiration
4. **Theft** - Product stolen
5. **Waste** - Product wasted
6. **Count Correction** - Fixing count discrepancies
7. **Transfer In** - Received from another location
8. **Transfer Out** - Sent to another location

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- **products** - Stock level is updated (`current_stock` field)
- **inventory_movements** - New record created for audit trail

### Audit Trail Fields
- Product ID
- Quantity change
- Movement type
- Reason
- Performed by (user ID)
- Unit cost (optional)
- Notes (optional)
- Timestamp
