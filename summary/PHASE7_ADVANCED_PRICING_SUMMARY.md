## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Pricing Logic Flow
```
1. Check customer VIP tier
   ├─> Apply VIP price if available
   └─> Calculate tier-based discount

2. Check active happy hours
   ├─> Validate time window
   ├─> Validate day of week
   ├─> Validate date range
   └─> Apply discount if eligible

3. Check customer events
   ├─> Get active offers for customer
   ├─> Validate offer expiry
   └─> Apply best available discount

4. Return final price
   └─> Lowest price wins (Happy Hour > VIP > Events)
```

### Repository Pattern
- **HappyHourRepository**: 9 methods (getAll, getById, getActive, create, update, delete, associateProducts, getHappyHourProducts, checkEligibility)
- **EventRepository**: 10 methods (getAll, getById, getActiveForCustomer, create, update, delete, redeem, checkExpired, getUpcoming, markNotificationSent)

### Service Layer
- **HappyHourPricing**: Time validation, discount application, price calculation
- **VIPPricing**: Tier management, savings calculation, renewal reminders
- **EventService**: Auto event creation, offer validation
- **OfferGeneration**: Tier-based offer creation, validity windows
- **RedemptionService**: Offer validation, discount calculation, redemption tracking
