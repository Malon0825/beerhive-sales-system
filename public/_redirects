# Netlify Redirects Configuration for BeerHive POS System
# This file handles client-side routing for Next.js Single Page Application
# 
# IMPORTANT: When using @netlify/plugin-nextjs, API routes are automatically
# handled by the plugin. DO NOT add manual redirects for /api/* routes as
# this will cause conflicts and 404 errors.
#
# The @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin automatically:
# - Handles Next.js API routes (/api/*)
# - Manages Next.js rewrites and redirects
# - Optimizes static and dynamic pages
#
# This file should ONLY contain SPA fallback for client-side routing

# Single Page Application fallback - serve index.html for all non-API routes
# This enables client-side routing to work properly
