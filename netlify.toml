# Netlify Configuration for BeerHive POS System
# This file defines the build settings, environment variables, and deployment configurations
# for deploying the Next.js application to Netlify.

[build]
  # Specifies the command to build the Next.js application
  # Clean cache before build to prevent false positive secret scanning
  command = "rm -rf .next/cache && npm run build"
  
  # Directory where the build output is stored

  # Node.js version requirement (must match package.json engines)

  # Ignore command allows Netlify to skip builds when only docs/non-code files change
  ignore = "git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF -- . ':!docs/' ':!*.md' ':!summary/'"

# ===================================
# SECRET SCANNING CONFIGURATION
# ===================================
# Netlify automatically scans builds for potential secrets.
# For Next.js apps, NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are INTENTIONALLY public
# and will appear in webpack cache - this is expected behavior.
# 
# We handle this by:
# 1. Cleaning cache before each build (rm -rf .next/cache)
# 2. Excluding cache directories in .netlifyignore
# 3. Documenting that NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are safe to expose
#
# If you see secret scanning warnings for NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:
# - This is a FALSE POSITIVE (these vars are meant to be public)
# - The anon key is protected by Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
# - Service role key is NEVER exposed (server-side only, no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
