# Netlify Configuration for BeerHive POS System
# This file defines the build settings, environment variables, and deployment configurations
# for deploying the Next.js application to Netlify.

[build]
  # Specifies the command to build the Next.js application
  command = "npm run build"
  
  # Directory where the build output is stored
  # For standalone output mode, use .next/standalone
  # The @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin will handle the deployment
  publish = ".next"
  
  # Node.js version requirement (must match package.json engines)
  NODE_VERSION = "18.17.0"
  
  # Ignore command allows Netlify to skip builds when only docs/non-code files change
  ignore = "git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF -- . ':!docs/' ':!*.md' ':!summary/'"

# Build environment variables
[build.environment]
  # Next.js specific environment variables for optimal Netlify deployment
  NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"
  
  # Set NETLIFY flag to true (used in next.config.js to disable caching)
  # This prevents webpack cache from triggering false positive secret scanning
  NETLIFY = "true"
  
  # Increase Node memory limit for large builds
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"

# Plugin configuration for Next.js on Netlify
# The @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin provides Next.js optimizations
# This plugin automatically:
# - Handles Next.js API routes at /api/*
# - Manages Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)
# - Optimizes build output for Netlify's CDN
# - Manages rewrites, redirects, and middleware

# Functions configuration for serverless bundle optimization
[functions]
  # Increase function size limit to accommodate Next.js server bundle
  # Default is 50MB, increase to 52MB for standalone builds

# ===================================
# SECRET SCANNING CONFIGURATION
# ===================================
# Netlify automatically scans builds for potential secrets.
# For Next.js apps, NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are INTENTIONALLY public
# and will appear in webpack cache - this is expected behavior.
# 
# SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
# 1. Disabled webpack filesystem caching in next.config.js when NETLIFY=true
# 2. Clean cache directories before build (rm -rf .next/cache .netlify/.next/cache)
# 3. Excluded cache directories in .netlifyignore (for deployment)
# 4. Documented that NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are safe to expose
#
# Trade-off: Builds are slightly slower without cache (~30-60s longer)
# Benefit: Eliminates false positive secret scanning warnings
#
# If you still see warnings for NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:
# - This is a FALSE POSITIVE (these vars are meant to be public)
# - The anon key is protected by Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
# - Service role key is NEVER exposed (server-side only, no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
# - Safe to acknowledge and proceed with deployment
