## 🔒 Security Status

### Verified Secure ✅

- ✅ No real secrets in source code
- ✅ Service role key only used server-side
- ✅ All secrets in Netlify environment variables
- ✅ Client bundle doesn't contain sensitive keys
- ✅ RLS policies protect database access

### Secret Scanning Explanation

**What triggered it:** Placeholder in `.env.netlify.example`
```bash
# Before (looked like real JWT)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.xxxxx

# After (obviously fake)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key-here
```

**Why it's safe:**
- It's an `.example` file (not real values)
- Real secrets are in Netlify Dashboard (not in code)
- No actual credentials were exposed
