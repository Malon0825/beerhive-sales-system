# Login 401 Error - Fixed! ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Issue**: 401 Unauthorized error when attempting to login  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Problem Summary

When attempting to login with admin credentials, you received:
```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login 401 (Unauthorized)
❌ [AuthContext] Login error: AppError: Invalid username or password
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Email Not Confirmed** ❌
   - The admin user's email was not confirmed in Supabase Auth
   - This prevented successful password authentication

2. **Password Mismatch** ❌
   - The password being entered did not match the password stored in Supabase Auth
   - Likely due to manual user creation without proper auth setup

3. **Roles Format Issue** (Minor) ⚠️
   - Roles were stored as string `"{admin}"` instead of proper array format
   - This didn't cause the 401 but could cause issues later

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Password Reset Utility ✅
Created two password reset scripts:
- `scripts/reset-admin-password.js` (JavaScript - no dependencies)
- `scripts/reset-admin-password.ts` (TypeScript version)

### 2. Reset Admin Password ✅
Ran the password reset script which:
- ✅ Found the admin user in database
- ✅ Reset password to `Admin123!`
- ✅ Confirmed the email address
- ✅ Verified user account is active
- ✅ Validated roles configuration

### 3. Enhanced Login API Route ✅
Improved `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` with:
- ✅ Comprehensive step-by-step authentication flow documentation
- ✅ Better error logging for debugging
- ✅ Detailed console logs at each authentication step
- ✅ Clear comments explaining each step

### 4. Created Documentation ✅
- ✅ `FIX_LOGIN_ERROR.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ `LOGIN_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Start Development Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Login Page
Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/login

### Step 3: Enter Credentials
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `Admin123!`

### Step 4: Click Sign In
You should be:
1. ✅ Successfully authenticated
2. ✅ Redirected to the dashboard (role-based routing)
3. ✅ See a welcome message or dashboard content

### Step 5: Change Password (Recommended)
After successfully logging in:
1. Navigate to Settings → Profile
2. Change your password to something secure
3. Follow password requirements:
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - At least 1 uppercase letter
   - At least 1 lowercase letter

## Authentication Flow (For Reference)

The login process follows these steps:

```
1. User submits username + password
   ↓
2. API looks up user by username in 'users' table
   ↓
3. Check if user account is active (is_active = true)
   ↓
4. Verify password with Supabase Auth (signInWithPassword)
   ↓
5. Update last_login timestamp
   ↓
6. Normalize roles data structure
   ↓
7. Create response with user data + session
   ↓
8. Set authentication cookies for middleware
   ↓
9. Return success response
   ↓
10. Frontend redirects to dashboard
```

**401 Error occurred at Step 4**: Password verification failed because:
- Email was not confirmed in Supabase Auth
- Password didn't match what was stored

## Prevention Tips

### ✅ Always Create Users via API
Use the proper user creation API:
```powershell
# Using PowerShell
$body = @{
    username = "testuser"
    email = "test@example.com"
    password = "TestPass123!"
    full_name = "Test User"
    role = "cashier"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/users" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

This ensures:
- User created in both `users` table AND `auth.users`
- Password properly hashed and stored
- Email automatically confirmed
- Roles configured correctly as arrays

### ✅ Don't Manually Insert into auth.users
- Always use Supabase Auth API or admin SDK
- Manual SQL inserts to `auth.users` won't work properly

### ✅ Keep Roles as Arrays
- Use `ARRAY['admin']::user_role[]` format
- Not string format like `'{admin}'`

### ✅ Use the Reset Script When Needed
If you forget a password or need to reset:
```powershell
node scripts/reset-admin-password.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 401 After Fix?
1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Del`
   - Clear all cookies for localhost
   
2. **Try incognito/private mode**
   - Rules out cookie/cache issues

3. **Verify password is correct**
   - It's case-sensitive: `Admin123!`
   - Not `admin123!` or `ADMIN123!`

4. **Check server is running**
   - Make sure `npm run dev` is running
   - Server should be on http://localhost:3000

5. **Check browser console**
   - Press F12
   - Look for detailed error messages
   - Check Network tab for API response

### Can't Run Reset Script?
If you get module errors:
```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd d:\Projects\beerhive-sales-system

# Make sure dependencies are installed
npm install

# Then run the script
node scripts/reset-admin-password.js
```

### Different User Account?
To reset password for a different user, modify the script:
```javascript
// Change this line in reset-admin-password.js
.eq('username', 'admin')  // Change 'admin' to your username
```
