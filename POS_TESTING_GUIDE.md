---

### âœ… Test 6: Stock Validation

**Test 6a: Out of Stock Product**

-- Should show 45
```

---

### âœ… Test 8: Search & Filter with Stock

**Steps**:
1. Enter search term (e.g., "beer")
2. Observe filtered results

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Stock After Purchase
```sql
-- Before purchase
SELECT id, name, current_stock FROM products WHERE name = 'Test Product';

-- Add to cart and complete payment

-- After purchase
SELECT id, name, current_stock FROM products WHERE name = 'Test Product';
-- Stock should be decreased
```

### Check Inventory Movements
```sql
SELECT 
  im.created_at,
  p.name as product_name,
  im.quantity_change,
  im.quantity_before,
  im.quantity_after,
  im.reason
FROM inventory_movements im
JOIN products p ON p.id = im.product_id
ORDER BY im.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Order Items
```sql
SELECT 
  o.id,
  o.order_number,
  oi.item_name,
  oi.quantity,
  oi.unit_price,
  oi.subtotal,
  o.status
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Stock not updating in UI
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Ensure StockTrackerProvider is wrapping CartProvider.

### Issue: Products not showing
**Solution**: Check if products have stock. Drinks with 0 stock are intentionally hidden.

### Issue: Stock becomes negative
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen. Check validation in handleUpdateQuantity. Report as bug.

### Issue: Stock not saved to DB after payment
**Solution**: Check OrderService.completeOrder() includes StockDeduction.deductForOrder().

### Issue: Cart not persisting
**Solution**: Check CartContext is properly initialized with userId.
