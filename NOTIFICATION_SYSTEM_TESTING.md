# Notification System - Testing & Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

The notification system is **fully implemented** and ready for testing. This guide will help you set up, test, and verify all features.

---

## üìã Pre-Testing Checklist

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

**Verify**: Check that `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area` is installed in `package.json`.

### 2. Run Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: The migration must be executed before testing!

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Open the file: `migrations/create_notifications_table.sql`
3. Copy the entire SQL content
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **RUN**
6. Verify success message

**Expected Output**:
- ‚úÖ `notifications` table created
- ‚úÖ 4 triggers created
- ‚úÖ RLS policies enabled
- ‚úÖ Helper functions created

### 3. Enable Realtime

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
2. Find `notifications` table
3. Toggle **Enable** for Realtime
4. Save changes

### 4. Regenerate Database Types

After running the migration, update your TypeScript types:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/models/database.types.ts
```

This will resolve all TypeScript errors in `NotificationRepository.ts`.

### 5. Notification Sound (Optional)

Follow instructions in `public/sounds/README.md` to add a notification sound, or skip this step for visual-only notifications.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Notifications Appear

**Solutions**:
1. Verify migration was executed successfully
2. Check Realtime is enabled for `notifications` table
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify user role matches notification target role

**Verify Triggers**:
```sql
SELECT tgname, tgenabled 
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname LIKE 'trigger_notify%';
```

Should show 4 triggers enabled.

### Issue: TypeScript Errors

**Solution**:
Regenerate database types after running migration:
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/models/database.types.ts
```

### Issue: Sound Not Playing

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser autoplay policy (user must interact with page first)
2. Verify notification is not muted
3. Check that sound file exists at `/public/sounds/notification.mp3`
4. Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox)

### Issue: Wrong User Sees Notification

**Check Role Targeting**:
- Order notifications ‚Üí Cashiers
- Kitchen/Bartender notifications ‚Üí Waiters
- Inventory notifications ‚Üí Managers

**Verify User Role**:
```sql
SELECT id, username, role FROM users WHERE id = 'USER_ID';
```

### Issue: Real-time Not Working

**Solutions**:
1. Check Supabase Realtime is enabled
2. Verify no firewall/network issues
3. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
4. Try refreshing the page

## üîç Database Verification

### Check Notifications

```sql
-- View all notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Count by type
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count FROM notifications GROUP BY type;

-- Unread count for specific user
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications 
WHERE (user_id = 'USER_ID' OR role = 'USER_ROLE') 
AND is_read = false;
```

### Check Triggers

```sql
-- Verify all triggers exist
SELECT 
    tgname as trigger_name,
    tgenabled as enabled,
    tgrelid::regclass as table_name
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname LIKE 'trigger_notify%'
ORDER BY tgname;
```

### Manual Notification Test

```sql
-- Create a test notification
INSERT INTO notifications (
    type,
    title,
    message,
    priority,
    role
) VALUES (
    'system_alert',
    'Test Notification',
    'This is a test message',
    'normal',
    'cashier'
);
```

---

## üìä Performance Testing

### Load Test

1. Create 50+ notifications
2. Check loading speed
3. Verify pagination works
4. Check scroll performance

### Cleanup Test

```sql
-- Run cleanup function
SELECT cleanup_old_notifications();

-- Verify old read notifications are deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications 
WHERE is_read = true 
AND read_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## üìù Integration Points

### Where Notifications Are Triggered

1. **Orders** ‚Üí `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` or OrderRepository
2. **Kitchen** ‚Üí `src/app/api/kitchen/route.ts` or KitchenOrderRepository
3. **Inventory** ‚Üí Database trigger (automatic on stock update)

### Manually Triggering Notifications

If needed, you can manually create notifications in your code:

```typescript
import { NotificationService } from '@/core/services/notifications/NotificationService';

// In your API route or service
await NotificationService.notifyOrderCreated(
  orderId,
  orderNumber,
  totalAmount
);
```
