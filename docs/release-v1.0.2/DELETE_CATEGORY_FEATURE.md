# Delete Category Feature

**Version:** v1.0.2  
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

## Overview

Added the ability to delete product categories from within the Edit Category dialog. Deletion is a **soft delete** that preserves data integrity while removing categories from active use.

---

## Features

### 1. Delete Button in Edit Dialog
- **Location:** Edit Category dialog footer (left side)
- **Appearance:** Red destructive button with trash icon
- **Availability:** Only appears when editing (not when creating)
- **Icon:** Trash can icon for clear visual indication

### 2. Confirmation Dialog
- **Safety:** Requires user confirmation before deletion
- **Information:** Explains impact of deletion
- **Clarity:** Shows category name being deleted
- **Education:** Explains soft delete vs hard delete

### 3. Soft Delete Implementation
- **Method:** Sets `is_active` to `false` in database
- **Preservation:** Category data remains in database
- **Products:** Products keep category reference
- **Visibility:** Category removed from active category lists
- **Reversible:** Can be restored by administrator via database

---

## User Experience

### Delete Flow

1. **Open Edit Dialog**
   - User clicks "Edit" button for a category
   - Edit Category dialog opens

2. **Initiate Delete**
   - User clicks red "Delete Category" button
   - Confirmation dialog appears

3. **Confirm Deletion**
   - Dialog shows: "Are you sure you want to delete '{category name}'?"
   - Explains consequences of deletion
   - User clicks "Delete Category" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort

4. **Success Feedback**
   - Toast notification: "Category deleted!"
   - Category list refreshes automatically
   - Deleted category no longer appears in dropdowns

### UI Elements

**Edit Dialog - Delete Button:**
```
[üóëÔ∏è Delete Category]  [Cancel]  [Update Category]
     ‚Üë Red                        ‚Üë Primary
     destructive
```

**Confirmation Dialog:**
```
Delete Category?
Are you sure you want to delete the category "Beers"?

‚ö†Ô∏è This action will remove the category from the active 
   category list. Products using this category will keep 
   their category reference, but the category won't 
   appear in dropdowns.

üìù Note: This is a soft delete and can be restored by 
   an administrator if needed.

[Cancel]  [Delete Category]
            ‚Üë Red/destructive
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (CategoryDialog.tsx)

#### State Management
```typescript
const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false);
const [showDeleteConfirm, setShowDeleteConfirm] = useState(false);
```

#### Delete Handler
```typescript
const handleDelete = async () => {
  if (!category?.id) return;

  try {
    setIsDeleting(true);

    const response = await fetch(`/api/categories/${category.id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    if (!response.ok || !result.success) {
      throw new Error(result.error?.message || 'Deletion failed');
    }

    toast({
      title: 'Category deleted!',
      description: `"${category.name}" has been removed from categories.`,
      variant: 'success',
    });

    onSuccess();
    onOpenChange(false);
  } catch (error) {
    toast({
      title: 'Failed to delete category',
      description: error.message,
      variant: 'destructive',
    });
  } finally {
    setIsDeleting(false);
  }
};
```

### Backend (Already Exists)

The DELETE endpoint was already implemented:

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/categories/[id]`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export async function DELETE(request: NextRequest, { params }) {
  const { id } = params;

  const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('product_categories')
    .update({ 
      is_active: false,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
    .eq('id', id)
    .select()
    .single();

  if (error) {
    throw new AppError('Category not found', 404);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    data: { id: data.id, name: data.name },
    meta: {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      message: `Category "${data.name}" deleted successfully`,
    },
  });
}
```

## Soft Delete vs Hard Delete

### Soft Delete (Current Implementation) ‚úÖ

**What happens:**
- `is_active` set to `false`
- Category data remains in database
- Products keep `category_id` reference
- Category hidden from active lists

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Reversible - can be restored
- ‚úÖ Data integrity - no orphaned products
- ‚úÖ Audit trail - deletion history preserved
- ‚úÖ Safe - no cascade deletions

**Drawbacks:**
- Database grows with inactive records
- Requires admin access to restore

### Hard Delete (Not Implemented)

**What would happen:**
- Row deleted from database
- Products lose category reference
- No way to restore

**Why we don't use it:**
- ‚ùå Irreversible
- ‚ùå Breaks foreign key references
- ‚ùå No audit trail
- ‚ùå Risky for production data

---

## Data Integrity

### Impact on Products

**Before Deletion:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category_id = 'uuid-123';
-- Returns products with category "Beers"
```

**After Deletion:**
```sql
-- Products still have category_id
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category_id = 'uuid-123';
-- Still returns same products

-- But category is inactive
SELECT * FROM product_categories 
WHERE id = 'uuid-123' AND is_active = true;
-- Returns 0 rows

-- Category still exists in database
SELECT * FROM product_categories WHERE id = 'uuid-123';
-- Returns the category with is_active = false
```

### Query Behavior

**Get Active Categories:**
```typescript
// This query excludes deleted categories
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('product_categories')
  .select('*')
  .eq('is_active', true);
// Deleted categories don't appear
```

**Get Product with Category:**
```typescript
// Product still has category reference
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('*, product_categories(*)')
  .eq('id', productId);
// Returns product with category (even if inactive)
```

---

## Security & Permissions

### Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ Any user with access to Edit Category can delete
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- ‚úÖ Soft delete preserves data

### Future Enhancement (Recommended)
- Add role-based permissions (admin/manager only)
- Add audit logging for deletions
- Add restore functionality in admin panel

---

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios

| Error | HTTP Status | Message | User Feedback |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Category not found | 404 | Category not found | "Failed to delete category: Category not found" |
| Database error | 500 | Failed to delete category | "Failed to delete category: An unexpected error occurred" |
| Network error | N/A | Network failure | "Failed to delete category: Network error" |

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Category not found"
}
```

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delete Unused Category
```
Given: Category "Test" exists with no products
When: User deletes "Test" category
Then: Category removed from list immediately
```

### Scenario 2: Delete Category with Products
```
Given: Category "Beers" exists with 10 products
When: User deletes "Beers" category
Then: 
  - Category removed from active list
  - 10 products still have category_id = "Beers"
  - Products can still be viewed/edited
  - "Beers" doesn't appear in new product form
```

### Scenario 3: Cancel Deletion
```
Given: User clicks "Delete Category"
When: Confirmation dialog appears
And: User clicks "Cancel"
Then: Dialog closes, category unchanged
```

### Scenario 4: Network Error
```
Given: Network is down
When: User confirms deletion
Then: Error toast appears
And: Category remains in list
```

## Restoration Process (Admin Only)

If a category needs to be restored:

```sql
-- Via database access
UPDATE product_categories 
SET is_active = true, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'uuid-of-deleted-category';
```

**Future Enhancement:** Add restore UI in admin panel

---
