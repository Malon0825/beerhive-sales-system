# Bug Fix Summary - Tab Management Price Recalculation

**Issue ID**: TAB-PRICE-001  
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Issue
When reducing or removing items via the "Manage Items" button in tab management, the order and session totals were not being recalculated, resulting in incorrect billing amounts and unreliable sales data.

## Root Cause
The `OrderModificationService` updated individual order items but did not recalculate the parent order's total. The database trigger that updates session totals only fires when the `orders` table changes, so it never triggered.

## Solution
Added `recalculateOrderTotals()` method to `OrderModificationService` that:
1. Sums all order item totals
2. Updates the order's total in the database
3. Triggers automatic session total update via existing database trigger

## Files Changed
- ✏️ `src/core/services/orders/OrderModificationService.ts` - Added recalculation logic

## Impact
- ✅ Order totals now update correctly when items are modified
- ✅ Session (tab) totals update automatically
- ✅ Sales data integrity maintained
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Backward compatible

## Testing
Manual testing required:
1. Open a tab with multiple items
2. Reduce item quantity via "Manage Items"
3. Verify order and session totals update immediately
4. Remove an item completely
5. Verify totals update correctly

## Deployment
- No database migrations required
- Deploy updated service file
- Restart application
