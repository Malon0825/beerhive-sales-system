# Release v1.0.2 - Tab Payment Mismatch Fix

**Release Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Priority:** Critical - Financial Accuracy Issue  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Deployment

---

## Quick Summary

Fixed a critical bug where Tab orders with multiple items were causing sales reports to show inflated payment amounts (3x-5x actual sales). The system was recording the full payment amount on each individual order within a tab, instead of only at the session level.

**Impact:** Tab with 3 orders totaling $100 → System recorded $300 in payments  
**Fix:** Payment details now stored only at session level → System correctly records $100

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Payment Duplication Bug
**File:** `src/core/services/orders/OrderSessionService.ts`

Removed duplicate payment amount assignment to individual orders in a tab. Payment details (`amount_tendered`, `change_amount`) are now stored only at the session level.

### 2. Reports Module
**File:** `src/data/queries/reports.queries.ts`

Updated sales report queries to:
- Query `order_sessions` table for tab sales
- Query `orders` table only for POS orders (no session)
- Prevent counting each order in a tab separately

---

## Files Changed

### Code (2 files)
1. `src/core/services/orders/OrderSessionService.ts` - Payment logic
2. `src/data/queries/reports.queries.ts` - Report queries

### Documentation (5 files)
1. `TAB_PAYMENT_DUPLICATION_FIX.md` - Technical details
2. `REPORTS_MODULE_FIX.md` - Report query changes
3. `data_migration_tab_payment_cleanup.sql` - Database cleanup
4. `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures
5. `BUGFIX_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary
6. `README.md` - This file

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Review code changes
- [ ] Run tests (see TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Backup production database

### 2. Code Deployment
```bash
# Deploy updated files
git checkout v1.0.2
npm run build
# Deploy to production
```

### 3. Data Migration
```bash
# Connect to production database
psql -h [host] -U [user] -d [database]

# Run migration script
\i docs/release-v1.0.2/data_migration_tab_payment_cleanup.sql
```

### 4. Verification
- [ ] Run Step 1-2 queries from migration script (verify affected records)
- [ ] Run Step 4 (execute cleanup)
- [ ] Run Step 5 (verify fix)
- [ ] Test closing a new tab
- [ ] Verify sales report shows correct amount

### 5. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor sales reports for 24-48 hours
- [ ] Compare report totals with physical cash/card
- [ ] Archive backup data after 1 week

## Quick Test

### Before Fix
```sql
-- Tab with 3 orders
SELECT session_id, order_number, total_amount, amount_tendered
FROM orders
WHERE session_id = 'some-session-id';

-- Result (WRONG):
-- Order 1: total: $30, tendered: $100
-- Order 2: total: $40, tendered: $100
-- Order 3: total: $30, tendered: $100
-- SUM(amount_tendered) = $300 ❌
```

### After Fix
```sql
-- Tab with 3 orders
SELECT session_id, order_number, total_amount, amount_tendered
FROM orders
WHERE session_id = 'some-session-id';

-- Result (CORRECT):
-- Order 1: total: $30, tendered: NULL
-- Order 2: total: $40, tendered: NULL
-- Order 3: total: $30, tendered: NULL
-- SUM(amount_tendered) = $0 ✅

-- Session level:
SELECT total_amount FROM order_sessions WHERE id = 'some-session-id';
-- Result: $100 ✅
```

---

## Verification Queries

### Check for Remaining Issues
```sql
-- Should return 0 rows after migration
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM orders 
WHERE session_id IS NOT NULL 
  AND amount_tendered IS NOT NULL;
```

### Verify Sales Accuracy
```sql
-- Compare today's sales with physical cash
SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN session_id IS NULL THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) as pos_sales,
  SUM(DISTINCT CASE WHEN session_id IS NOT NULL THEN os.total_amount ELSE 0 END) as tab_sales
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_sessions os ON o.session_id = os.id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND DATE(o.completed_at) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Fixed
- ✅ Sales reports show accurate totals
- ✅ Financial reconciliation matches physical payments
- ✅ Cashier performance reports accurate
- ✅ Payment method breakdown correct
- ✅ Hourly sales analysis accurate

### ✅ Unchanged (Working As Expected)
- ✅ POS orders (single order payment)
- ✅ Product sales reports
- ✅ Category reports
- ✅ Inventory reports
- ✅ Customer visit reports

### ⚠️ Requires Action
- ⚠️ Run data migration to clean up existing records
- ⚠️ Verify sales reports after deployment
- ⚠️ Monitor for any edge cases

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

1. **Code Rollback**
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0.1
   npm run build
   # Deploy previous version
   ```

2. **Data Rollback** (if needed)
   ```sql
   -- Restore from backup table
   -- See migration script for details
   ```

3. **Report Issues**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Contact development team
   - Plan fix for next release
