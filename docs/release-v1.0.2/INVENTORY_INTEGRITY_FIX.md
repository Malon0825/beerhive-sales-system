# Inventory Integrity Fix - Release v1.0.2

## Executive Summary

This fix addresses **3 CRITICAL LOOPHOLES** in the inventory/stock monitoring system that allowed items to be sold without proper stock deduction, compromising inventory integrity and system reliability.

## Issues Identified

### üî¥ Critical Issue #1: Tab Orders Bypassing Stock Deduction

**Problem**: Tab orders could be paid without confirming orders, resulting in NO inventory deduction.

**Root Cause**:
- User adds items to tab ‚Üí Creates DRAFT order with NO stock deduction
- User closes/pays tab ‚Üí `OrderSessionService.closeTab()` assumes stock was already deducted
- Payment collected, but inventory never reduced

**Impact**: 
- **HIGH** - Orders completed and paid but inventory never updated
- Stock counts become increasingly inaccurate over time
- Impossible to trust inventory reports
- Potential overselling of products

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `OrderSessionService.closeTab()` to check order status before completing
- If order was never CONFIRMED (still DRAFT/PENDING), stock is deducted at payment time
- Comprehensive logging added to track when stock deduction occurs
- Graceful error handling prevents payment failure if stock deduction fails (logs warning for manual adjustment)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/services/orders/OrderSessionService.ts` (lines 220-305)

---

### üî¥ Critical Issue #2: Package Items Never Deduct Stock

**Problem**: Packages contain products but their component items were never deducted from inventory.

**Root Cause**:
- Package order items have `product_id: null` (only `package_id` is set)
- `StockDeduction.deductForOrder()` only processed items with `product_id`
- Package components were expanded for kitchen routing but NOT for inventory
- Packages could be sold indefinitely without reducing stock

**Impact**:
- **HIGH** - Complete inventory blindspot for all package sales
- Stock never reduced for any item in a package
- Inventory reports completely inaccurate for package component products
- Significant financial risk if packages contain expensive items

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `StockDeduction.deductForOrder()` to detect and expand package items
- When package detected, fetches package configuration from database
- Deducts stock for each component product (quantity √ó package multiplier)
- Applied same logic to `StockDeduction.returnForVoidedOrder()` for consistency
- Detailed logging shows which products come from packages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/services/inventory/StockDeduction.ts` (lines 1-285)
  - Added `PackageRepository` import
  - Enhanced type signatures to accept `package_id`
  - Added package expansion logic with error handling
  - Added source tracking (product vs package) for audit trail

---

### üî¥ Critical Issue #3: Race Conditions in Stock Updates

**Problem**: Non-atomic stock updates could cause overselling in concurrent scenarios.

**Root Cause**:
- Original implementation used read-modify-write pattern:
  1. Read current stock
  2. Calculate new stock
  3. Write new stock (separate operation)
- Multiple concurrent orders could read same stock value before any writes complete
- Example: 10 in stock, 3 concurrent orders for 4 units each ‚Üí All see 10, all succeed, result: -2 stock

**Impact**:
- **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Rare but catastrophic when it occurs
- Only happens under high concurrent load
- Can cause negative stock values
- Difficult to detect and diagnose

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented atomic database-level stock adjustment using PostgreSQL function
- Created `adjust_product_stock_atomic()` stored procedure with row-level locking
- Uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to lock product row during adjustment
- Validates and updates stock in single atomic transaction
- Fallback to regular update if migration not applied (with warning logged)
- Database ensures only one adjustment processes at a time per product

**Files Modified**:
- `src/data/repositories/InventoryRepository.ts` (lines 205-332)
- `migrations/release-v1.0.2/add_atomic_stock_adjustment.sql` (new file)

## Implementation Details

### Stock Deduction Flow (Fixed)

#### POS Orders (Direct Payment)
1. Order created with `payment_method` ‚Üí Status: PENDING
2. Auto-confirm triggered ‚Üí Status: CONFIRMED
3. **Stock deducted immediately** ‚úÖ
4. Kitchen routing triggered
5. Payment completes ‚Üí Status: COMPLETED

#### Tab Orders (Before Fix) ‚ùå
1. Order created without payment ‚Üí Status: DRAFT
2. User might or might not confirm order
3. Tab closed/paid ‚Üí Status: COMPLETED
4. **Stock never deducted if not confirmed** ‚ùå

#### Tab Orders (After Fix) ‚úÖ
1. Order created without payment ‚Üí Status: DRAFT
2. If user confirms: Stock deducted ‚Üí Status: CONFIRMED
3. If user skips confirm: Tab close detects DRAFT status
4. **Stock deducted at payment time** ‚úÖ
5. All orders completed with accurate inventory

### Package Handling (Fixed)

#### Before Fix ‚ùå
```javascript
// Package order item
{
  product_id: null,
  package_id: "uuid-123",
  quantity: 2
}
// StockDeduction skipped (no product_id)
// Stock never deducted for any component products ‚ùå
```

#### After Fix ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Package order item detected
{
  product_id: null,
  package_id: "uuid-123",
  quantity: 2
}

// System expands package:
// Package "Bucket Deal" contains:
// - 6x Beer A ‚Üí Deduct 12 units (6 √ó 2)
// - 1x Wings  ‚Üí Deduct 2 units (1 √ó 2)
// All component stock properly deducted ‚úÖ
```

### Atomic Updates (Fixed)

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Tab Order Without Confirmation
**Scenario**: Create tab order, add items, close tab without confirming orders

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Orders created in DRAFT status
2. Warning logged: "Order was never confirmed! Stock was NOT deducted yet. Deducting now..."
3. Stock deducted at payment time
4. Inventory movements logged with correct quantities

**Verification**:
- Check `inventory_movements` table for entries with `movement_type = 'sale'`
- Verify product `current_stock` reduced by correct amount
- Check console logs for deduction confirmation

---

### Test Case 2: Package Order
**Scenario**: Order a package containing multiple products

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Package order created with `package_id`, `product_id: null`
2. On confirmation, package expanded to component products
3. Stock deducted for each component (quantity √ó component quantity)
4. Logs show: "Added package component: [Product] x[Qty] (from package '[Name]' x[Qty])"

**Verification**:
- Check stock levels for ALL component products (not just package)
- Verify inventory movements created for each component product
- Verify movement `notes` references package name

---

### Test Case 3: Concurrent Orders
**Scenario**: Simulate 5 concurrent orders for same product with limited stock

**Setup**:
- Product stock: 10 units
- Create 5 concurrent orders each requesting 3 units (total: 15 units)

**Expected Behavior**:
1. First 3 orders succeed (stock: 10 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 1)
2. Last 2 orders fail with "Insufficient stock" error
3. Final stock: 1 unit (not negative)

**Verification**:
- Check database: `SELECT current_stock FROM products WHERE id = ?`
- Verify stock is non-negative
- Check inventory_movements count matches successful orders only

---

### Test Case 4: Voided Package Order
**Scenario**: Void an order containing a package

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Package components identified
2. Stock returned for each component product
3. Inventory movements logged with `movement_type = 'void_return'`

**Verification**:
- Check component product stock increased correctly
- Verify inventory movements show returns for all components
- Verify final stock = initial stock (full round-trip)

---

## Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Run the atomic stock adjustment migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/release-v1.0.2/add_atomic_stock_adjustment.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check function exists
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name = 'adjust_product_stock_atomic';

-- Test function
SELECT adjust_product_stock_atomic(
  'your-product-uuid'::uuid,
  -5  -- Try to deduct 5 units
);
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application Code
- Deploy updated code to staging environment first
- Run test cases 1-4 above
- Monitor logs for any errors or warnings
- Deploy to production after validation

### Step 4: Monitor Post-Deployment
**Watch for these log patterns**:

‚úÖ **Success indicators**:
```
‚úÖ [OrderSessionService.closeTab] Stock successfully deducted for order
‚úÖ [InventoryRepository.adjustStock] Stock updated atomically
üì¶ [StockDeduction.deductForOrder] Added package component
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning indicators** (require attention):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [OrderSessionService.closeTab] Order was never confirmed! Stock was NOT deducted yet
‚ö†Ô∏è [InventoryRepository.adjustStock] Atomic RPC not available, using fallback
```

‚ùå **Error indicators** (require immediate action):
```
‚ùå [OrderSessionService.closeTab] CRITICAL: Stock deduction failed
‚ùå [StockDeduction.deductForOrder] Failed to deduct product
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### Option 1: Emergency Rollback
1. Revert application code to previous version
2. Database migration can remain (backward compatible)
3. Old code will use fallback non-atomic updates

### Option 2: Keep New Code, Remove Atomic Function
```sql
-- Remove atomic function, code will use fallback
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS adjust_product_stock_atomic(UUID, NUMERIC);
```

---

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- **Atomic function**: Slightly faster than read-modify-write pattern (single round-trip)
- **Better concurrency**: Database handles queuing, no application-level retries needed

### Considerations:
- **Row-level locking**: High-volume products may see slight serialization
- **Mitigation**: Database lock queue is very efficient, impact should be negligible
- **Recommendation**: Monitor query performance on `adjust_product_stock_atomic` calls

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. **Inventory Movement Volume**: Daily count of `sale` movements
2. **Package Expansion Success Rate**: Count of package components deducted
3. **Stock Deduction Failures**: Count of orders with failed deductions
4. **Negative Stock Incidents**: Alert if any product has `current_stock < 0`
5. **Atomic Function Usage**: Track RPC calls vs fallback usage

### Recommended Alerts:
```sql
-- Alert: Products with negative stock (should never happen)
SELECT id, name, sku, current_stock
FROM products
WHERE current_stock < 0;

-- Alert: Orders completed without stock deduction
SELECT o.id, o.order_number, o.status, o.completed_at
FROM orders o
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.completed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM inventory_movements im
    WHERE im.order_id = o.id
      AND im.movement_type = 'sale'
  );
```

---

## Success Criteria

### System is considered stable when:
1. ‚úÖ All test cases pass consistently
2. ‚úÖ No negative stock values in database
3. ‚úÖ Inventory movements match order completions (1:1 ratio)
4. ‚úÖ Package component stock accurately reflects sales
5. ‚úÖ No race condition errors in logs during load testing
6. ‚úÖ Atomic function successfully processes >99% of stock adjustments

---

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements:
1. **Stock Reservation System**: Reserve stock when order created, deduct on payment
2. **Low Stock Warnings**: Alert staff when critical items running low
3. **Automated Reconciliation**: Daily job to verify order/inventory consistency
4. **Audit Dashboard**: Real-time view of inventory movements and discrepancies
5. **Package Stock Validation**: Pre-validate package component availability before order creation
