# Reports Module Fix - Session-Based Sales Handling

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Version:** v1.0.2  
**Related To:** Tab Payment Duplication Fix  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Overview

Updated the reports module to correctly handle session-based (Tab) orders by querying the `order_sessions` table directly instead of aggregating individual orders within a session. This prevents counting the same tab multiple times in sales reports.

---

## Problem

**Before Fix:**
- Reports queried only the `orders` table
- For tabs with multiple orders (e.g., 3 orders in one session), each order was counted separately
- Total sales were inflated when tabs had multiple orders
- Example: Tab with 3 orders totaling $100 → Report showed $100 + $100 + $100 = $300

**After Fix:**
- Reports query `order_sessions` table for tabs
- Each tab is counted once with its session total
- POS orders (no session) are still counted individually
- Example: Tab with 3 orders totaling $100 → Report shows $100

## Files Modified

### `src/data/queries/reports.queries.ts`

#### 1. `getSalesByDateRange()`
**What Changed:**
- Split query into two parts: POS orders + closed sessions
- POS orders: Query `orders` table where `session_id IS NULL`
- Tab orders: Query `order_sessions` table where `status = 'closed'`
- Combine both result sets for complete sales data

**Why:**
- Ensures each tab is counted once, not once per order
- Maintains accurate sales totals
- Preserves backward compatibility with POS orders

**Impact:**
- All other report functions depend on this, so fixing this fixes daily sales, summaries, etc.

---

#### 2. `getSalesByHour()`
**What Changed:**
- Query POS orders and sessions separately
- Aggregate by hour from both sources

**Why:**
- Peak hours analysis must account for both order types
- Session close time determines when tab revenue is recognized

---

#### 3. `getSalesByPaymentMethod()`
**What Changed:**
- Query POS orders for payment method
- Query sessions and get payment method from first order in session
- Aggregate both sources

**Why:**
- Payment method is stored on individual orders but represents entire session
- Prevents counting same payment method multiple times per session

---

#### 4. `getSalesByCashier()`
**What Changed:**
- Query POS orders for cashier
- Query sessions and get cashier from first order (who closed the tab)
- Aggregate both sources

**Why:**
- Cashier who closes tab gets credit for entire session amount
- Prevents inflating cashier sales by counting each order separately

---

## Functions NOT Changed

The following functions were **not** modified because they work correctly at the order item level:

- `getTopProducts()` - Aggregates order items (correct)
- `getAllProductsSold()` - Aggregates order items (correct)
- `getSalesByCategory()` - Aggregates order items (correct)
- `getCustomerVisitFrequency()` - Uses order completion dates (acceptable)
- `getInventoryTurnover()` - Uses order items (correct)
- `getLowStockItems()` - Product-level query (not affected)
- `getVoidedTransactions()` - Voided orders query (not affected)
- `getDiscountAnalysis()` - Discount table query (not affected)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Before (Incorrect)
```typescript
// Only queried orders table
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('...')
  .gte('completed_at', startDate)
  .lte('completed_at', endDate)
  .eq('status', 'completed');

// Result: Multiple orders per tab = inflated totals
```

### After (Correct)
```typescript
// Query POS orders (no session)
const { data: posOrders } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('...')
  .is('session_id', null)
  .gte('completed_at', startDate)
  .lte('completed_at', endDate)
  .eq('status', 'completed');

// Query closed sessions (tabs)
const { data: sessions } = await supabase
  .from('order_sessions')
  .select('...')
  .eq('status', 'closed')
  .gte('closed_at', startDate)
  .lte('closed_at', endDate);

// Combine both
return [...posOrders, ...transformedSessions];
```

## Data Model

### POS Order Flow
```
Customer → Order → Payment → Completed
         (single transaction)
```

### Tab Order Flow
```
Customer → Session → Order 1 → Confirmed
                  → Order 2 → Confirmed
                  → Order 3 → Confirmed
                  → Close Tab → Payment → Completed
         (multiple orders, single payment at session level)
```

---

## Testing Verification

### Test Case 1: POS Order Only
```sql
-- Create POS order: $50
-- Run report
-- Expected: Shows $50
```

### Test Case 2: Tab Order Only
```sql
-- Create tab with 3 orders: $30 + $40 + $30 = $100
-- Close tab
-- Run report
-- Expected: Shows $100 (not $300)
```

### Test Case 3: Mixed Orders
```sql
-- Create POS order: $50
-- Create tab with 2 orders: $40 + $60 = $100
-- Run report
-- Expected: Shows $150 total
```

### Test Case 4: Multiple Tabs Same Hour
```sql
-- Create tab 1: $100 at 2:00 PM
-- Create tab 2: $150 at 2:30 PM
-- Run hourly report
-- Expected: Hour 14 (2:00 PM) shows $250
```

## SQL Query Examples

### Get Total Sales (Correct Method)
```sql
-- POS sales + Tab sales
SELECT 
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN o.session_id IS NULL THEN o.total_amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS pos_sales,
  COALESCE(SUM(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.session_id IS NOT NULL THEN os.total_amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS tab_sales,
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN o.session_id IS NULL THEN o.total_amount ELSE 0 END), 0) + 
  COALESCE(SUM(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.session_id IS NOT NULL THEN os.total_amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_sessions os ON o.session_id = os.id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.completed_at >= '2025-10-12 00:00:00'
  AND o.completed_at <= '2025-10-13 23:59:59';
```

### Alternative: Query Separately
```sql
-- POS Sales
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as pos_sales
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND session_id IS NULL
  AND completed_at >= '2025-10-12 00:00:00'
  AND completed_at <= '2025-10-13 23:59:59';

-- Tab Sales
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as tab_sales
FROM order_sessions
WHERE status = 'closed'
  AND closed_at >= '2025-10-12 00:00:00'
  AND closed_at <= '2025-10-13 23:59:59';

-- Total = pos_sales + tab_sales
```

## Impact Analysis

### ✅ Fixed Reports
1. **Daily Sales Report** - Now shows accurate totals
2. **Sales by Hour** - Correctly aggregates peak hours
3. **Sales by Payment Method** - Accurate payment breakdown
4. **Sales by Cashier** - Correct cashier performance
5. **Sales Summary** - Total revenue matches physical collections

### ✅ Unchanged (Still Work Correctly)
1. **Product Sales Reports** - Work at item level
2. **Category Reports** - Work at item level
3. **Inventory Reports** - Not affected by order structure
4. **Customer Reports** - Visit counting still valid

### ⚠️ Considerations
- Historical reports now show correct data after this fix
- No data migration needed for reports module
- Reports automatically use new query logic

---

## Benefits

1. **Financial Accuracy** - Sales reports match cash register
2. **Performance Insights** - Accurate cashier and hourly data
3. **Data Integrity** - Consistent sales tracking across order types
4. **Scalability** - Handles any number of orders per tab correctly

---

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ POS orders work exactly as before
- ✅ Existing report UI components unchanged
- ✅ Report service layer unchanged
- ✅ API endpoints unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to report data structure

---

## Deployment Notes

1. Deploy updated `reports.queries.ts`
2. No database migrations required
3. No cache clearing needed
4. Reports immediately reflect correct data
5. Historical reports automatically corrected

---

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add `is_session` flag to report results for filtering
2. Create separate "Tab Sales" and "POS Sales" report views
3. Add session duration metrics to reports
4. Track average orders per tab
5. Add session-level discounts to reports

### Database Optimization
1. Add indexes on `order_sessions.closed_at`
2. Add indexes on `orders.session_id`
3. Consider materialized views for large date ranges

---

## Summary

This fix ensures that sales reports accurately reflect business operations by:
- Counting each tab **once** (at session level)
- Counting each POS order **once** (at order level)
- Preventing duplication and inflation of sales figures
- Maintaining compatibility with existing reporting infrastructure

The fix is transparent to end users and immediately improves data accuracy across all sales reports.

**Status:** ✅ Complete and ready for deployment
