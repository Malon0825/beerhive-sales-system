**Version:** 1.0.2  
**Module:** Reports & Analytics Dashboard  
**Summary:** Multiple UX and functionality improvements based on user feedback

---

## Overview

This document summarizes all improvements made to the Reports module in version 1.0.2, addressing user feedback and fixing UI/UX issues.

---

## Changes Summary

### 1. ⭐ Business Hours Alignment (5pm - 5pm Cycle) - CRITICAL

**Issue:** Date filters used calendar days (12am-11:59pm), but operations run 5pm to 5pm next day.

**Solution:** ALL date range filters now align with business operation hours:
- **Today:** 5pm yesterday → 5pm today (current business day)
- **Yesterday:** 5pm 2 days ago → 5pm yesterday (previous business day)
- **Last 7 Days:** 5pm 8 days ago → 5pm today (7 complete business days)
- **Last 30 Days:** 5pm 31 days ago → 5pm today (30 complete business days)
- **Custom Range:** Defaults to 5pm yesterday → 5pm today

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reports match actual business day cycles
- ✅ "Today" includes last night's operations
- ✅ No split data across arbitrary calendar boundaries
- ✅ Accurate daily comparisons

**Files Modified:**
- `src/views/reports/DateRangeFilter.tsx`
- `src/views/reports/ReportsDashboard.tsx`

**Documentation:** `BUSINESS_HOURS_ALIGNMENT.md`

---

### 2. Custom Range Default Time (Updated to 5pm - 5pm)

**Issue:** Users had to manually select dates every time they wanted to view the current business day revenue.

**Solution:** Custom Range filter now defaults to current business day (5pm-5pm cycle).

**Benefits:**
- One-click access to current business day reports
- Pre-populated values can still be customized
- Consistent with other filters

**Files Modified:**
- `src/views/reports/DateRangeFilter.tsx`

**Documentation:** `CUSTOM_RANGE_DEFAULT_FIX.md`, `BUSINESS_HOURS_ALIGNMENT.md`

---

### 3. Bar Chart Toggle Button

**Issue:** "Our users are more familiar with bar graphs"

**Solution:** Added toggle button to switch between Bar and Line charts:
- **Bar Chart (Default)** - Easier to compare values
- **Line Chart** - Better for trend analysis

**Features:**
- Modern toggle UI with icons
- Active state highlighting
- Instant switching
- Preserves selection during session

**Files Modified:**
- `src/views/reports/ReportsDashboard.tsx`
- `src/views/reports/SalesChart.tsx`

**Documentation:** `CHART_TYPE_TOGGLE_FEATURE.md`

---

### 4. Bar Width Limitation

**Issue:** When applying custom range with few days (1-2 days), bars became unnecessarily wide.

**Solution:** Limited maximum bar width to 60 pixels with proper spacing:
- `maxBarSize={60}` - Prevents oversized bars
- `barGap={8}` - Consistent spacing between bars
- `barCategoryGap={20}` - Good spacing between categories

**Benefits:**
- Clean appearance regardless of data point count
- Better visual proportions
- Consistent user experience

**Files Modified:**
- `src/views/reports/SalesChart.tsx`

---

## Revenue Calculation Query

Provided the actual SQL query for total revenue calculation:

```sql
-- Combines POS orders and Tab sessions to prevent duplication
SELECT 
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT SUM(total_amount) 
     FROM orders 
     WHERE session_id IS NULL 
       AND completed_at >= :start_date
       AND completed_at <= :end_date
       AND status = 'completed'),
    0
  ) +
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT SUM(total_amount) 
     FROM order_sessions 
     WHERE status = 'closed' 
       AND closed_at >= :start_date
       AND closed_at <= :end_date),
    0
  ) as total_revenue;
```

**Key Points:**
- Separates POS orders (no session) from Tab sessions
- Prevents double-counting of tab-based sales
- Uses local datetime format (Philippines UTC+8)

---

## Technical Details

### Date/Time Handling

All date filters use **local datetime format** to preserve Philippines timezone (UTC+8):

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`

**Example:**
- Start: `2025-10-16T18:00:00` (6pm Oct 16)
- End: `2025-10-17T05:00:00` (5am Oct 17)

**Important:** No UTC conversion - prevents 8-hour timezone shift issue.

## Support Notes

### Common User Questions

**Q: Why does "Today" show yesterday's date?**  
A: Your business day starts at 5pm. "Today" means the current business day (5pm yesterday to 5pm today), which includes last night's operations.

**Q: Why does the custom range default to 5pm-5pm?**  
A: This matches the business operating hours. You can still change it to any time range you need.

**Q: Which chart type should I use?**  
A: Bar charts are better for comparing values. Line charts are better for seeing trends over time.

**Q: Why are the bars a fixed width?**  
A: This prevents them from becoming too wide when you filter to just 1-2 days, keeping the chart readable.

**Q: How is revenue calculated?**  
A: POS orders are counted individually. Tab orders are counted once when the tab is closed (not for each item).
