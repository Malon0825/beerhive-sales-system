# Bug Fix Summary - Tab Payment Mismatch

**Issue ID:** Tab Module Payment/Billing Discrepancy  
**Reported:** Sales mismatch between physical payments and system records  
**Fixed:** October 17, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical - Financial accuracy issue

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed a critical bug in the Tab module where payment amounts were being duplicated across multiple orders within the same session, causing sales reports to show inflated payment totals compared to actual physical cash/card collected.

**Example Impact:**
- Tab with 3 orders totaling $100
- Customer pays $100
- **Before:** System recorded $300 in payments (3 √ó $100)
- **After:** System correctly records $100 in payments

---

## Root Cause

In `OrderSessionService.closeTab()`, when closing a tab containing multiple orders, the full session payment amount (`amount_tendered` and `change_amount`) was being assigned to **each individual order** instead of being stored only at the session level.

---

## Solution

**Code Change:**
- Modified `src/core/services/orders/OrderSessionService.ts` (lines 226-238)
- Removed `amount_tendered` and `change_amount` from individual order updates
- Payment details now stored only at the session level (as designed)

**Data Migration:**
- Created SQL script to clean up existing duplicate payment records
- Script location: `docs/release-v1.0.2/data_migration_tab_payment_cleanup.sql`

## Files Modified

### Code Changes
1. **src/core/services/orders/OrderSessionService.ts**
   - Removed payment amount duplication in `closeTab()` method
   - Added clarifying comments about session-level payment handling

2. **src/data/queries/reports.queries.ts**
   - Updated `getSalesByDateRange()` to query sessions separately
   - Updated `getSalesByHour()` to handle both POS and tab orders
   - Updated `getSalesByPaymentMethod()` to aggregate correctly
   - Updated `getSalesByCashier()` to credit tab closers properly
   - All changes prevent counting tab orders multiple times in reports

## Testing Required

### Pre-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Test single-order tab payment
- [ ] Test multi-order tab payment (3+ orders)
- [ ] Test POS order payment (ensure unchanged)
- [ ] Verify sales reports show correct totals

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Run data migration script
- [ ] Verify no orders with `session_id` have `amount_tendered` set
- [ ] Compare daily sales report with physical cash/card collected
- [ ] Monitor for any edge cases

---

## Deployment Checklist

1. **Code Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy updated `OrderSessionService.ts` to production
   - [ ] Verify deployment successful

2. **Data Migration**
   - [ ] Backup production database
   - [ ] Run verification queries (Step 1 & 2 in migration script)
   - [ ] Execute cleanup UPDATE statement (Step 4)
   - [ ] Verify fix with Step 5 query
   - [ ] Validate sales totals with Step 6 query

3. **Validation**
   - [ ] Process test tab with multiple orders
   - [ ] Verify payment amounts not duplicated
   - [ ] Run sales report and compare with expected values
   - [ ] Monitor system for 24-48 hours

4. **Cleanup**
   - [ ] Drop backup table after 1 week (if no issues)
   - [ ] Archive migration scripts

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ Benefits
- **Financial Accuracy:** Sales reports now match physical payments
- **Data Integrity:** Eliminates duplicate payment recording
- **Reporting Reliability:** Cashier and sales reports are now accurate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks
- **Low Risk:** Minimal code change, well-isolated
- **Data Migration:** Requires database update (reversible with backup)
- **Testing:** Thorough testing recommended before production

### üìä Scope
- **Affected:** Tab-based orders only
- **Unaffected:** POS orders (single-order payments)
- **Backward Compatible:** Existing reports use `total_amount` (correct field)

---

## Prevention Measures

### Code Review Guidelines
- Payment amounts should never be duplicated across related records
- Session-level data belongs at session level, not on child records
- Always verify aggregation logic matches data model

### Future Enhancements
- Add database constraint: `CHECK (session_id IS NULL OR amount_tendered IS NULL)`
- Add automated tests for tab payment scenarios
- Add API validation to reject invalid payment data structures

---

## Support Information

### If Issues Arise

**Symptom:** Sales reports still showing inflated amounts
- **Check:** Data migration completed successfully
- **Action:** Re-run verification queries from migration script

**Symptom:** Tab payment fails
- **Check:** Application logs for errors
- **Action:** Verify session exists and is in OPEN status

**Symptom:** POS orders affected
- **Check:** POS orders should still have `amount_tendered` set
- **Action:** Review order creation logic, ensure `session_id` is NULL

### Rollback Procedure
If critical issues occur:
1. Restore code from previous version
2. Run rollback SQL (commented in migration script)
3. Report issue to development team

---

## Conclusion

This fix addresses a critical financial accuracy issue in the Tab module. The solution is minimal, focused, and maintains backward compatibility. With proper testing and data migration, this fix will ensure sales reports accurately reflect actual business transactions.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for deployment  
**Priority:** High - Financial accuracy  
**Complexity:** Low - Single file change + data migration
