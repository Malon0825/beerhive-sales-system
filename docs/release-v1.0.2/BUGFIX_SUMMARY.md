# Bug Fix Summary - Release v1.0.2

## Fixes Included in This Release

### 1. Tab Payment Mismatch (COMPLETED)
**Issue ID:** Tab Module Payment/Billing Discrepancy  
**Reported:** Sales mismatch between physical payments and system records  
**Fixed:** October 17, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical - Financial accuracy issue

### 2. Inventory Integrity Issues (NEW)
**Issue ID:** Inventory Stock Deduction Loopholes  
**Reported:** Stock not reliably deducted for all sales  
**Fixed:** October 17, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical - Inventory integrity issue

---

## Executive Summary

This release contains TWO critical fixes that address financial accuracy and inventory integrity:

### Fix #1: Tab Payment Duplication
Fixed payment amounts being duplicated across multiple orders within the same session, causing sales reports to show inflated payment totals.

**Example Impact:**
- Tab with 3 orders totaling $100
- Customer pays $100
- **Before:** System recorded $300 in payments (3 × $100)
- **After:** System correctly records $100 in payments

### Fix #2: Inventory Stock Deduction Loopholes
Fixed THREE critical loopholes where products were sold without proper stock deduction:

1. **Tab orders never confirmed** → Stock not deducted even when paid
2. **Package items** → Component products never had stock reduced
3. **Race conditions** → Concurrent orders could oversell inventory

**Example Impact:**
- Tab with 10 beers closed without confirming → Stock never reduced
- Package "Bucket Deal" (6 beers + wings) sold → No stock deduction at all
- 5 concurrent orders for same product → Could oversell and go negative

---

## Root Cause

In `OrderSessionService.closeTab()`, when closing a tab containing multiple orders, the full session payment amount (`amount_tendered` and `change_amount`) was being assigned to **each individual order** instead of being stored only at the session level.

---

## Solution

**Code Change:**
- Modified `src/core/services/orders/OrderSessionService.ts` (lines 226-238)
- Removed `amount_tendered` and `change_amount` from individual order updates
- Payment details now stored only at the session level (as designed)

**Data Migration:**
- Created SQL script to clean up existing duplicate payment records
- Script location: `docs/release-v1.0.2/data_migration_tab_payment_cleanup.sql`

---

## Testing Required

### Pre-Deployment Testing - Tab Payment Fix
- [ ] Test single-order tab payment
- [ ] Test multi-order tab payment (3+ orders)
- [ ] Test POS order payment (ensure unchanged)
- [ ] Verify sales reports show correct totals

### Pre-Deployment Testing - Inventory Fix
- [ ] Test tab order without confirming (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Test package order and verify component stock deduction
- [ ] Test concurrent orders for same product (load test)
- [ ] Test void order with package items
- [ ] Verify inventory movements logged correctly

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Run payment cleanup migration script
- [ ] Apply atomic stock adjustment migration
- [ ] Verify no orders with `session_id` have `amount_tendered` set
- [ ] Verify no products have negative `current_stock`
- [ ] Compare daily sales report with physical cash collected
- [ ] Check inventory movements match order completions
- [ ] Monitor logs for "was never confirmed" warnings
- [ ] Monitor for any edge cases

---

## Deployment Checklist

1. **Code Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy all updated files to production
   - [ ] Verify deployment successful
   - [ ] Check application starts without errors

2. **Database Migrations**
   - [ ] Backup production database (CRITICAL)
   - [ ] Apply atomic stock adjustment migration:
     ```bash
     psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/release-v1.0.2/add_atomic_stock_adjustment.sql
     ```
   - [ ] Verify function created: `SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_name = 'adjust_product_stock_atomic';`
   - [ ] Run payment cleanup migration (if needed)
   - [ ] Verify no negative stock: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE current_stock < 0;`

3. **Validation - Tab Payment**
   - [ ] Process test tab with multiple orders
   - [ ] Verify payment amounts not duplicated
   - [ ] Run sales report and compare with expected values

4. **Validation - Inventory**
   - [ ] Create tab order without confirming, then close tab
   - [ ] Verify stock was deducted (check `inventory_movements`)
   - [ ] Order package item and verify components deducted
   - [ ] Check logs for atomic function usage
   - [ ] Verify no "insufficient stock" errors for valid orders

5. **Monitoring (First 48 Hours)**
   - [ ] Watch for "Order was never confirmed" warnings
   - [ ] Monitor for stock deduction failures
   - [ ] Check for negative stock incidents
   - [ ] Verify atomic function being used (no fallback warnings)
   - [ ] Compare sales with inventory movements

6. **Cleanup**
   - [ ] Drop backup table after 1 week (if no issues)
   - [ ] Archive migration scripts

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Benefits
- **Financial Accuracy:** Sales reports now match physical payments
- **Data Integrity:** Eliminates duplicate payment recording
- **Reporting Reliability:** Cashier and sales reports are now accurate

### ⚠️ Risks
- **Low Risk:** Minimal code change, well-isolated
- **Data Migration:** Requires database update (reversible with backup)
- **Testing:** Thorough testing recommended before production

### 📊 Scope
- **Affected:** Tab-based orders only
- **Unaffected:** POS orders (single-order payments)
- **Backward Compatible:** Existing reports use `total_amount` (correct field)

---

## Prevention Measures

### Code Review Guidelines
- Payment amounts should never be duplicated across related records
- Session-level data belongs at session level, not on child records
- Always verify aggregation logic matches data model

### Future Enhancements
- Add database constraint: `CHECK (session_id IS NULL OR amount_tendered IS NULL)`
- Add automated tests for tab payment scenarios
- Add API validation to reject invalid payment data structures

---

## Support Information

### If Issues Arise

**Symptom:** Sales reports still showing inflated amounts
- **Check:** Data migration completed successfully
- **Action:** Re-run verification queries from migration script

**Symptom:** Tab payment fails
- **Check:** Application logs for errors
- **Action:** Verify session exists and is in OPEN status

**Symptom:** POS orders affected
- **Check:** POS orders should still have `amount_tendered` set
- **Action:** Review order creation logic, ensure `session_id` is NULL

### Rollback Procedure
If critical issues occur:
1. Restore code from previous version
2. Run rollback SQL (commented in migration script)
3. Report issue to development team

---

## Conclusion

This release addresses TWO critical issues that compromise system integrity:

1. **Financial Accuracy** - Tab payment duplication fix ensures sales reports match actual payments
2. **Inventory Integrity** - Stock deduction fixes ensure reliable inventory tracking

Both fixes are production-ready with comprehensive documentation, testing procedures, and rollback plans. The changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving system reliability.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for deployment  
**Priority:** Critical - Financial accuracy + Inventory integrity  
**Complexity:** Medium - Multiple files + database migration  
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium with proper testing  
**Testing Time:** 2-4 hours recommended  
**Deployment Window:** Off-peak hours recommended

### Key Benefits
- ✅ Accurate sales reports matching physical payments
- ✅ Reliable inventory tracking across all order types
- ✅ Prevention of overselling through atomic updates
- ✅ Complete audit trail for all stock movements
- ✅ Staff can trust system data for decision-making
