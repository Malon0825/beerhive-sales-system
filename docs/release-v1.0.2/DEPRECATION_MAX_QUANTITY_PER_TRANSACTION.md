# Deprecation: max_quantity_per_transaction Field

**Version**: v1.0.2  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Removed  
**Type**: Breaking Change (Schema)  

---

## Executive Summary

The `max_quantity_per_transaction` field has been **removed** from the packages table and all application code. This static limit has been replaced by **dynamic stock availability calculation** through the unified inventory system.

**Impact**: 
- ✅ No breaking changes to actual functionality (field was never enforced)
- ✅ Simplified package management
- ✅ More accurate availability based on real-time stock
- ✅ Reduced configuration complexity

---

## Rationale

### Why Remove This Field?

#### 1. **Never Enforced in Application Logic**
Analysis revealed that `max_quantity_per_transaction` was **displayed but never validated**:

```typescript
// ❌ CartContext - Added packages with quantity: 1, ignored limit
const newItem: CartItem = {
  quantity: 1,  // Hardcoded, never checked against max_quantity_per_transaction
  // ...
};

// ❌ updateQuantity - No validation against package limits
const updateQuantity = (itemId: string, quantity: number) => {
  // Accepts ANY quantity, no check against max_quantity_per_transaction
};
```

**Result**: The field created a **false sense of control** without actual enforcement.

---

#### 2. **Redundant with Dynamic Inventory System**

The unified inventory system (v1.0.2) calculates package availability dynamically:

```typescript
// PackageAvailabilityService.ts
max_sellable = Math.floor(component_stock / quantity_per_package);
```

**Example**:
```
Package: VIP Bundle
  - Beer A: 2 units per package
  - Snacks: 1 unit per package

Current Stock:
  - Beer A: 50 units → 25 packages available
  - Snacks: 100 units → 100 packages available

Actual Availability: MIN(25, 100) = 25 packages
```

This is **more accurate** than a static `max_quantity_per_transaction = 10` field.

---

#### 3. **Violates Single Responsibility Principle**

Having two different limits creates confusion:

```
Static Limit:  max_quantity_per_transaction = 10
Dynamic Limit: Only 5 packages available (stock constraint)

❓ Which one wins?
❓ Which one should be displayed to users?
❓ How to keep them in sync?
```

**Solution**: Single source of truth → **Inventory controls availability**

---

#### 4. **Increases Configuration Burden**

Managers had to:
- ❌ Manually set quantity limits for each package
- ❌ Update limits when stock patterns change
- ❌ Remember that limits weren't actually enforced
- ❌ Explain why "Max 10" doesn't prevent selling 50

**After removal**:
- ✅ System automatically calculates availability
- ✅ No manual configuration needed
- ✅ Always accurate and up-to-date

---

## Changes Made

### Database Migration

**File**: `migrations/release-v1.0.2/drop_max_quantity_per_transaction.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE packages 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS max_quantity_per_transaction;
```

**Safety**: 
- Migration includes pre-check to show packages with custom limits
- All limits were default (1) or never enforced, so no data loss

---

### TypeScript Types

**File**: `src/models/entities/Package.ts`

**Removed from**:
- `Package` interface (line 15)
- `CreatePackageInput` interface (line 44)
- `UpdatePackageInput` interface (line 66)

**Marked with comment**:
```typescript
// max_quantity_per_transaction: REMOVED - Use PackageAvailabilityService for dynamic limits
```

---

### UI Components Updated

#### 1. **PackageForm.tsx**
**Changed**: Removed quantity input field  
**Added**: Informational note about dynamic limits

```tsx
{/* Info: Dynamic Quantity Limits */}
<div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-3">
  <p className="text-sm text-blue-900">
    <strong>ℹ️ Quantity Limits:</strong> Package quantities are now controlled 
    dynamically based on component product stock availability. The system 
    automatically calculates maximum sellable packages.
  </p>
</div>
```

**Before**: 3-column grid with max quantity input  
**After**: 2-column grid (valid_from, valid_until) + info note

---

#### 2. **PackageList.tsx**
**Changed**: Display message updated

```tsx
// ❌ Before
<span>Max {pkg.max_quantity_per_transaction} per transaction</span>

// ✅ After
<span>Quantity based on stock availability</span>
```

---

#### 3. **Package Detail Page** (`packages/[packageId]/page.tsx`)
**Changed**: Removed static limit display

```tsx
// ❌ Before
<span className="text-gray-600">Max per transaction:</span>
<span className="font-medium text-gray-900">{packageData.max_quantity_per_transaction}</span>

// ✅ After
<span>Quantity controlled by component stock availability</span>
```

---

### Repository Updates

**File**: `src/data/repositories/PackageRepository.ts`

**Removed from**:
- `create()` method - Line 210
- `update()` method - Line 265

**Before**:
```typescript
max_quantity_per_transaction: input.max_quantity_per_transaction ?? 1,
```

**After**: Field removed entirely from insert/update operations

---

### Context Updates

**File**: `src/lib/contexts/CartContext.tsx`

**Removed from**: Package mock object (line 164) used when loading cart from IndexedDB

---

## Migration Guide

### For Users (Managers/Admins)

**No action required!** The change is transparent:

1. **Creating Packages**: No longer need to set max quantity
2. **Viewing Packages**: Now shows "Based on stock availability" instead of a number
3. **Selling Packages**: Works exactly the same, but limits are now accurate

---

### For Developers

#### If Extending Package System:

**Old way** (don't do this):
```typescript
if (quantity > package.max_quantity_per_transaction) {
  throw new Error('Exceeds limit');
}
```

**New way** (use this):
```typescript
import { PackageAvailabilityService } from '@/core/services/inventory/PackageAvailabilityService';

const availability = await PackageAvailabilityService.calculatePackageAvailability(packageId);

if (quantity > availability.max_sellable) {
  throw new Error(`Only ${availability.max_sellable} packages available`);
}
```

#### If Integrating with External Systems:

**API Change**: The `packages` endpoint no longer returns `max_quantity_per_transaction`

**Migration**:
```typescript
// ❌ Old code
const maxQty = package.max_quantity_per_transaction;

// ✅ New code - use availability service
const availability = await fetch(`/api/packages/${package.id}/availability`);
const maxQty = availability.max_sellable;
```

## Testing Checklist

### Automated Tests
- [x] Database migration runs successfully
- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds (no type errors)
- [x] Package creation works without max_quantity field
- [x] Package updates work without max_quantity field
- [ ] Unit tests updated for PackageRepository

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Create new package → No max quantity field shown ✅
- [ ] Edit existing package → Field not displayed ✅
- [ ] View package list → Shows "based on stock availability" ✅
- [ ] View package details → Shows dynamic message ✅
- [ ] Add package to cart → No errors ✅
- [ ] Sell package → Inventory deducts correctly ✅
- [ ] Check package availability → Uses dynamic calculation ✅

---

## Rollback Plan

**If you need to restore this field** (not recommended):

### 1. Database Migration
```sql
ALTER TABLE packages 
ADD COLUMN max_quantity_per_transaction INTEGER DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL;

COMMENT ON COLUMN packages.max_quantity_per_transaction IS 
'(DEPRECATED) Static quantity limit - replaced by dynamic stock availability';
```

### 2. TypeScript Types
Restore field definitions in `Package.ts`, `CreatePackageInput`, `UpdatePackageInput`

### 3. UI Components
Restore input fields in `PackageForm.tsx` and displays in other components

### 4. Repository
Restore field in `PackageRepository.create()` and `update()` methods

**⚠️ Warning**: Rollback should only be done if business requirements change. The unified inventory system is the recommended approach.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Use Cases for Quantity Limits

If **business requirements** emerge for static limits beyond stock (e.g., promotional caps, anti-hoarding), consider:

#### Option 1: Add Back as Optional Override
```typescript
interface Package {
  // ... other fields
  promotional_limit?: number; // Optional override for special cases
}
```

**Use case**: "Black Friday: Max 2 VIP packages per customer (regardless of stock)"

#### Option 2: Order-Level Limits
```typescript
interface Order {
  items: OrderItem[];
  business_rules: {
    max_packages_per_order?: number;
  }
}
```

**Use case**: System-wide order limits

#### Option 3: Customer-Tier Limits
```typescript
interface PackageTierLimit {
  package_id: string;
  customer_tier: 'regular' | 'vip';
  max_quantity: number;
}
```

**Use case**: "VIP customers can buy more"

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Will existing packages be affected?
**A**: No. Existing packages continue to work normally. The field was never enforced, so removing it doesn't change behavior.

---

### Q: What about packages with custom limits set?
**A**: The migration logs show which packages had custom values. Since these were never enforced, no business logic was dependent on them. Dynamic availability is more accurate.

---

### Q: How do I limit package quantities now?
**A**: You don't need to! The system automatically limits based on component stock:
- If a package needs 2 beers and you have 10 beers, max 5 packages can be sold
- This is calculated in real-time and always accurate

---

### Q: What if I NEED a static limit for business reasons?
**A**: Contact the development team to discuss your specific use case. We can add back as an optional override if there's a valid business requirement (e.g., promotional limits, regulatory compliance).

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
- **Clean removal**: Field was never used, so no complex migration logic needed
- **Improved accuracy**: Dynamic limits are more reliable than static configuration
- **Simplified UX**: One less field for managers to configure

### What Could Be Improved 🔍
- **Earlier detection**: Field should have been removed when inventory system was implemented
- **Better documentation**: Should have documented that field was never enforced
- **Validation gap**: Should have implemented validation if field was meant to be enforced

### Technical Debt Addressed ✅
- Removed dead field from schema
- Eliminated confusion about two different limit sources
- Aligned codebase with actual behavior
