# Package Item Fix Implementation

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: When packages were added in the POS module, they were being decoupled into individual products in the current order section, defeating the purpose of packages which should be sold at a discounted bundle price.

**Date Fixed**: October 10, 2025
**Version**: v1.0.2

## Root Cause

The `CartContext.addPackage()` function was iterating through package items and adding each product individually using `addItem()`, which resulted in:
1. Each package item appearing as a separate line item
2. Each item priced individually at product price, not package price
3. Loss of package identity and discount benefit

## Solution

### 1. Updated CartItem Interface

Modified the `CartItem` interface to support both products and packages:

```typescript
export interface CartItem {
  id: string;
  product?: Product;              // Only set for product items
  package?: Package & { items?: any[] }; // Only set for package items
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  subtotal: number;
  discount: number;
  notes?: string;
  itemName: string;               // Display name
  isPackage: boolean;             // Flag to identify type
}
```

### 2. Fixed CartContext.addPackage()

Changed package handling to add as a single item with package price:

**Before**:
```typescript
// Incorrect: Added each package item separately
for (const packageItem of pkg.items) {
  await addItem(product, packageItem.quantity);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Correct: Add package as single item with package price
const itemData: CurrentOrderItem = {
  package_id: pkg.id,
  item_name: pkg.name,
  quantity: 1,
  unit_price: pkg.base_price,    // Package price, not individual prices
  subtotal: pkg.base_price,
  discount_amount: 0,
  total: pkg.base_price,
};
```

### 3. Updated OrderSummaryPanel

Enhanced to display packages with:
- Package badge indicator
- Package contents listing
- Disabled quantity controls (packages are sold as complete units)
- Clear pricing per package

### 4. Enhanced POSInterface Stock Handling

Added `handleAddPackage()` function that:
1. Validates stock for all package items before adding
2. Reserves stock in memory for each item in the package
3. Shows detailed error if any item is out of stock
4. Only adds package if all items have sufficient stock

**Stock Release on Remove**:
```typescript
if (item.isPackage && item.package?.items) {
  // Release stock for all items in the package
  item.package.items.forEach((packageItem: any) => {
    stockTracker.releaseStock(packageItem.product.id, packageItem.quantity);
  });
}
```

## Kitchen Routing (Already Working)

The `KitchenRouting.ts` service already correctly handles packages:

```typescript
// If it's a package, expand it and route each item individually
if (item.package_id) {
  const packageOrders = await this.routePackageItems(orderId, item);
  kitchenOrders.push(...packageOrders);
}
```

**Process**:
1. Detects package by checking `package_id`
2. Fetches package details with all items
3. Routes each product to appropriate station (kitchen/bartender)
4. Uses product name for display on station screens
5. Includes package reference in special instructions

This ensures:
- ✅ Kitchen receives food items
- ✅ Bartender receives beverage items
- ✅ Each station knows it's part of a package
- ✅ Products are named correctly (not just "Package Name")

## Database Structure

The database already supported this properly:

**current_order_items table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE current_order_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  current_order_id UUID REFERENCES current_orders(id),
  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),  -- NULL for packages
  package_id UUID REFERENCES packages(id),  -- NULL for products
  item_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  quantity NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  unit_price NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  subtotal NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  total NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  -- Constraint ensures either product_id OR package_id is set
  CONSTRAINT check_product_or_package CHECK (
    (product_id IS NOT NULL AND package_id IS NULL) OR
    (product_id IS NULL AND package_id IS NOT NULL)
  )
);
```

## Files Modified

### Core Context
- `src/lib/contexts/CartContext.tsx` - Updated CartItem interface and addPackage logic

### UI Components
- `src/views/pos/components/OrderSummaryPanel.tsx` - Enhanced package display
- `src/views/pos/POSInterface.tsx` - Added handleAddPackage with stock validation

### Already Correct (No Changes Needed)
- `src/core/services/kitchen/KitchenRouting.ts` - Already expands packages correctly
- `src/views/pos/SessionOrderFlow.tsx` - Tab module already handled correctly
- `src/data/repositories/CurrentOrderRepository.ts` - Supports both products and packages

## Testing Checklist

### POS Module
- [x] Add package to cart
- [x] Package appears as single item with package name
- [x] Package price is correct (not sum of individual items)
- [x] Package badge displayed
- [x] Package contents shown in summary
- [x] Quantity controls disabled for packages
- [x] Remove package releases all item stock
- [x] Stock validation prevents adding if items unavailable

### Tab Module
- [x] Add package to session order
- [x] Package appears as single item
- [x] Package pricing correct

### Kitchen/Bartender Routing
- [x] Package items routed to correct stations
- [x] Kitchen receives food items from package
- [x] Bartender receives beverage items from package
- [x] Product names displayed correctly (not package name)
- [x] Special instructions indicate package membership

### Order Completion
- [x] Receipt shows package as single line item
- [x] Package price on receipt
- [x] Stock deducted for all package items

## Benefits

1. **Correct Pricing**: Package sold at bundle price, not individual item prices
2. **Proper Discounting**: Package discount preserved throughout flow
3. **Clear UI**: Customers see package as cohesive unit
4. **Stock Management**: All package items tracked and reserved
5. **Kitchen Integration**: Items still routed to correct stations
6. **Professional System**: Matches commercial POS systems behavior

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Insufficient Stock**: Package cannot be added if any item lacks stock
2. **Stock Reservation**: All items in package reserved when added
3. **Stock Release**: All items released when package removed
4. **VIP Packages**: VIP-only packages respect customer tier
5. **Multiple Packages**: Same package can be added multiple times
6. **Cart Restoration**: Packages restored correctly on page reload

## Migration Notes

No database migration required - schema already supported this correctly.

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. Allow quantity adjustment for packages (currently fixed at 1)
2. Add package customization (substitute items)
3. Show individual item stock levels in package card
4. Package stock indicator (red/yellow/green based on component availability)

## Standards Compliance

- ✅ Functions documented with JSDoc comments
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined
- ✅ No files exceed 500 lines
- ✅ NextJS component architecture followed
- ✅ No modifications outside issue scope
- ✅ Professional system patterns implemented
