# Sidebar Tab Reorder - UI Improvement

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Type**: Minor UI Enhancement

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Reordered Navigation Menu

Moved the **Tab Management** module to the second position in the sidebar, right after Dashboard.

#### New Menu Order:

```
1. Dashboard
2. Tab ⭐ (Moved from position 7)
3. POS
4. Kitchen
5. Bartender
6. Waiter
7. Tables
8. Current Orders
9. Order Board
10. Inventory
11. Customers
12. Packages
13. Happy Hours
14. Events
15. Reports
16. Settings
```

**Rationale**: Tab Management is a core operational feature that's frequently accessed by cashiers and managers. Placing it near the top improves discoverability and reduces navigation time.

---

### 2. Renamed Module

Changed the label from **"Tab Management"** to **"Tab"** for a cleaner, more concise UI.

**Before**: `Tab Management`  
**After**: `Tab`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Shorter, cleaner label
- ✅ Less visual clutter
- ✅ Matches common POS terminology
- ✅ Maintains clear meaning

---

## Technical Details

**File Modified**: `src/views/shared/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// ✨ Moved to position 2 (after Dashboard)
{
  label: 'Tab',  // 🔄 Renamed from 'Tab Management'
  icon: <Receipt className="h-5 w-5" />,
  href: '/tabs',
  roles: [UserRole.ADMIN, UserRole.MANAGER, UserRole.CASHIER],
}
```

**Lines Changed**: ~30 lines (menu item reordering)

---

## User Impact

### Before
- Tab Management was in position 7
- Label: "Tab Management"
- Users had to scroll or scan past 6 items

### After
- Tab is now in position 2
- Label: "Tab"
- Users see it immediately after Dashboard
- Faster access to tab-related operations
