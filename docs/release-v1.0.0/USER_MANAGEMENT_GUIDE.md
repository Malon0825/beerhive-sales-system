## Deactivation vs Deletion

### Deactivation (Soft Delete) ‚úÖ Recommended

- Orders/history remain intact

- Use only for test accounts

**Best Practice**: Always deactivate instead of delete.

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management
1. **Strength Requirements**
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - At least 1 uppercase letter
   - At least 1 lowercase letter  
   - At least 1 number
   - Consider special characters for extra security

2. **Temporary Passwords**
   - Auto-generated 12 characters
   - Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Shown only once
   - Must be changed on first use

3. **Password Reset**
   - Use secure channel to share (not email/SMS if possible)
   - User should change immediately
   - Old password invalidated immediately

### User Account Security
1. **Deactivate Immediately** when:
   - Employee leaves company
   - Suspected security breach
   - Extended leave of absence
   - Role change requires it

2. **Regular Audits**
   - Review active users monthly
   - Check last login dates
   - Deactivate unused accounts (90+ days)
   - Verify role assignments

3. **Least Privilege Principle**
   - Grant minimum required access
   - Don't give Admin unless necessary
   - Review Manager assignments regularly
   - Limit Cashier access to POS only
