# Netlify Build Configuration Fix

## Issue
Netlify build was failing with the error:
```
Plugin "@netlify/plugin-nextjs" does not accept any inputs but you specified: "includeFiles"
```

## Root Cause
The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin (version 5.13.4) does not support the `includeFiles` parameter that was configured in `netlify.toml`. This parameter was an attempt to include heavy PDF-related dependencies from node_modules at runtime instead of bundling them.

## Solution

### 1. **Removed Invalid Plugin Configuration**
**File:** `netlify.toml`

**Removed:**
```toml
[plugins.inputs]
  includeFiles = [
    "node_modules/@react-pdf/**",
    "node_modules/react-pdf/**",
    "node_modules/pdfjs-dist/**",
    "node_modules/canvas/**"
  ]
```

**Reason:** The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` doesn't accept any inputs/configuration.

### 2. **Simplified Build Command**
**File:** `netlify.toml`

**Changed from:**
```toml
command = "rm -rf .next/cache .netlify/.next/cache && npm run build"
```

**To:**
```toml
command = "npm run build"
```

**Reason:** Cache clearing is no longer necessary since we're handling dependencies through webpack externalization instead of the plugin configuration.

### 3. **Fixed Receipt Route Configuration**
**File:** `src/app/api/orders/[orderId]/receipt/route.ts`

**Removed:**
```typescript
export const config = {
  type: 'experimental-background',
};
```

**Reason:** This experimental Next.js feature doesn't work properly with Netlify and was causing confusion.

## How PDF Dependencies Are Now Handled

The PDF generation functionality works correctly through **webpack externalization** configured in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
// SERVER-SIDE: Externalize heavy dependencies
config.externals.push({
  '@react-pdf/renderer': 'commonjs @react-pdf/renderer',
  'canvas': 'commonjs canvas',
  'bufferutil': 'commonjs bufferutil',
  'utf-8-validate': 'commonjs utf-8-validate',
});
```

This approach:
- ✅ **Reduces serverless function size** - Dependencies aren't bundled
- ✅ **Loads from node_modules at runtime** - Same goal as `includeFiles` but works correctly
- ✅ **Compatible with Netlify** - Uses standard webpack externals
- ✅ **Uses dynamic imports** - Receipt route imports PDF libraries only when needed

## Verification

The build should now complete successfully without errors. The PDF generation functionality remains fully operational:

- **HTML receipts:** `/api/orders/[orderId]/receipt?format=html`
- **PDF receipts:** `/api/orders/[orderId]/receipt?format=pdf`
- **Text receipts:** `/api/orders/[orderId]/receipt?format=text`

## Files Modified

1. `netlify.toml` - Removed invalid plugin configuration and simplified build command
2. `src/app/api/orders/[orderId]/receipt/route.ts` - Removed experimental config
3. `next.config.js` - Already had correct webpack externalization (no changes needed)

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit changes to git
2. Push to your repository
3. Netlify will automatically trigger a new build
4. Build should complete successfully
5. Test PDF generation on the deployed site
