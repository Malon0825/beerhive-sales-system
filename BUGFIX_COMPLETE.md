# 🎉 Bug Fix Complete - Tab Management Price Recalculation

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL ⚠️  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED AND READY FOR TESTING

---

## 📋 Summary

Successfully fixed the critical bug where **order and session totals were not updating** when items were reduced or removed via the "Manage Items" button in tab management.

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### The Problem
- Staff could reduce item quantities in tabs
- Items were updated ✅
- Stock was returned ✅
- Kitchen was notified ✅
- **BUT prices stayed the same** ❌
- This caused incorrect billing and unreliable sales data

### The Solution
Added automatic price recalculation that:
1. Sums all remaining order items
2. Updates the order's total in the database
3. Triggers the session (tab) total update via existing database trigger
4. Ensures reliable sales data for reporting

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Service Layer
- **`src/core/services/orders/OrderModificationService.ts`**
  - ✅ Added `recalculateOrderTotals()` method (lines 487-552)
  - ✅ Integrated into `reduceItemQuantity()` (line 179)
  - ✅ Integrated into `removeOrderItem()` (line 301)
  - ✅ Comprehensive error handling
  - ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
